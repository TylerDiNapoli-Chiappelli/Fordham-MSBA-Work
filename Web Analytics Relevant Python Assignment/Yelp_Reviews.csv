1,5 star rating,"I was arguing with someone over which NYC restaurant had the best xiaolongbao (soup dumplings)--my vote was for The Bao/Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao (two sister restaurants), but I have to say, Shanghai 21's xiaolongbao are preeeetty comparable.If you love less meat / thin dumpling skin / fair portion of soup in your xiaolongbao, then you have to try them here! I ordered the pork ones (6pc), the steamed watercress &amp; shrimp dumplings (4pc), and the mapo tofu ""Modern Peking Style Sauteed Tofu."" All three dishes were amazing, and the tofu was great over a side of white rice. In terms of how they're handling health and safety measures, they have a handful of tables along the sidewalk that are each separated by a plexiglass divider. The utensils are all plastic (chopsticks are wooden of course), and the dishes aside from the dumplings come in takeout containers. They also served tea in a metal teapot but gave us paper cups. I'd def recommend if you're in the area!"
2,5 star rating,"First time back since they transformed Mott Street with outdoor dining space (through a city initiative called DineOut NYC). Same delicious food with all the necessary cleaning and distance precautions. Shanghai 21 has 3-4 tables all physically spaced and separated by clear plastic partitions. The outdoor street dining is separated from the cars by cute planters and far enough removed from sidewalk foot traffic that it feels comfortable. Everything is served in take-out containers (with the exception of the xiao long bao and steamed dumplings, which come in their usual bamboo steam trays) and you're provided disposable plates and utensils. The server is constantly sanitizing everything, including their hands. They also have takeout."
3,5 star rating,"KEY COVID TAKEAWAYS:- Each server is wearing a mask- Hand Sanitizer station available- Each chair and table is properly cleaned before seating the next guest.- Plastic Dividers between each table-Most of the food is served in take-out containers- Disposable utensils I came here for the first time Post-COVID and honestly, the experience was still just as amazing as I remembered. I always order soup dumplings and shanghai style lo-mein with pork. I also decided to try out the pork buns. I don't know how to give this place the praise it rightfully deserves. It's so surprising how even as we are forced to dine outdoors only, the food is still served so fresh and piping hot, which is how soup dumplings should be enjoyed. The soup dumplings have such an explosion of flavor and are stuffed with generous amounts of pork as well. Make sure to ask for chili oil and soy sauce, as they do not leave the sauce containers out anymore, for proper measures. Also, make sure to try and avoid peak dinner times, as there aren't many seats available and you will have to wait a longer time than usual"
4,5 star rating,BEST SOUP DUMPLINGS IN NYC!!!! I've had my fair share of  soup dumplings and by far the best. Also they have a great selection of food as well. Please try the Kung Pão Chicken amazing flavor and some heat!! Tip: they serve family portions so a little goes a long way!!!
5,4 star rating,"This place has yummy no-frills Shanghainese cuisine that is at least somewhat authentic, going by the soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were delicious with thin skins that did not rupture until we bit into them, and the familiar delicate meatiness of the filling and soup. I find the skin to be particularly difficult to nail, and commend them for this. The zhajiangmian was very tasty (I prefer the Chinese version and find it to taste more refreshing and healthy, but my (Korean) boyfriend disagrees lol). The kung pao chicken was very tender and slightly spicy, with plenty of fresh peppers. The eggplant was kind of bland and I didn't see any minced pork that we asked for, but we needed that healthy veggie dish. I find that I prefer eggplant when it is grilled in foil, but not all places do this so I shouldn't have expected it. Prices are a little steep for what you get, but this is NYC. Service is prompt, and the setting is very hygienic, with everything served in disposable containers and utensils. The bathroom is very clean as well."
6,5 star rating,"Wow! This is for dine in only. Just come and eat here, you won't regret it. Some of the best Chinese food I've had in New York! This will be one of my go to spots. I wasn't even able to take proper photos because the food was so good I immediately started eating. They have maybe 6 or so outdoor tables and indoor dining open. Everything felt clean and all servers were properly wearing masks. All food comes in to go containers and meal comes with hot tea. FYI, if you order alcohol you have to pay in cash before they bring it to you. My order is below--Crab and pork soup dumplings: very good, but I like Noodle Villages more. -Pork soup dumplings: a must! Some of the best I've had aside from Din Tai Fung. -House special fried pork chop: the best thing we ordered. A little greasy, but sooooo good. -Spicy wontons: tasty, but the soup dumplings are way better. -Green beans: way better than I was excepting. Super flavorful. -Lo mein with chicken: comes with bok choy and other veggies. Good if you're craving some noodles."
7,2 star rating,"They used to serve good soup dumplings...Came here during quarantine to support local chinese business. I only love to eat soup dumpling when it's right out of the kitchen, so I even just wait there for 15 min so I can eat when it's the freshest.However, two order of soup dumplings, both were lukewarm when I ate it in the car right out of kitchen, skin was thick (used to be thin), but half of them were broken already, and as I ate, all of them broke. Meat filling and flavor doesn't taste fresh. It tasted like microwave food but yet didn't microwave thoroughly. There were a unpleasant after taste of it remains and sort of gross me out the rest of the day.I was so excited to have soup dumplings, sad."
8,5 star rating,"Have dined here multiple times pre-COVID. Typically order a few orders of the pork soup dumplings and one order of the pork &amp; crabmeat soup dumplings, wontons in chili oil, watercress with enoki mushrooms, mapo tofu and a stir fry noodle dish. At times, we have ordered scallion pancakes and other buns (the fluffy bao ones). Service is attentive and quick. Wait times very during peak hours. Does not accept reservations so would plan to go early/off-peak.Outdoor dining for COVID. Very nice staff. Would recommend for quality soup dumplings (fan of the delicate skin!)"
9,4 star rating,"If in search of soup dumplings, I would recommend this spot for their black truffle one. It's a unique burst of flavor. Otherwise, the standard pork soup dumplings and Kung Pao chicken we tried were tasty, but obviously not unique to this restaurant.I definitely plan on returning for the black truffle soup dumplings. Everything if very fair priced as well.After I second visit, I should add that even the entreés here are delicious. The tangerine beef, in particular, is perfectly crisp with just enough hint of citrus. I highly recommend this restaurant. To clarify, this is Shanghai 21 on Mott St. There is another restaurant with a similar name in the area.This was an excellent spot for a group outing- super affordable with a generous portions and no lack of options."
10,5 star rating,"So glad to see our favorite dim sum place open for outdoor dining. There are only a few tables so get here early!!! The food is every bit as good though I am missing the ability to get chili sauce at my whim. All the dishes are served in single serve containers except the steamed stuff and you are safely cordoned off by plexi glass barriers. I must've missed the ownership change but they take cards other than discover and Amex now. Mm can't wait to come back. Our go tos are crab xlb, spicy Szechuan wontons, shrimp dumplings, bamboo shoots and pan fried pork buns. I wish they would serve or let us bring beers :)"
11,5 star rating,"Fantastic food here, sort of a mix between classic Chinese/American, authentic Chinese and gourmet Chinese. The soup dumplings here seem to have a thicker skin than some of the others I've had all over Chinatown. They seem to hold a lot more soup because of it and I consider them to be the best soup dumplings in Chinatown. I also can't say enough for their spicy, Szechuan wontons. They are delicious. The spicy sauce isn't truly authentic Szechuan but it's very spicy and full of flavor. I also think you have to try their Lo Mein dishes before leaving here. The noodles are thick and chewy and melt in your mouth. I will be visiting this place over and over when I am looking for something a little less starchy than Wo-Hop and a little more authentic."
12,4 star rating,"These sheng jian baos thoooooo = must get! They're only pan fried and crispy at the bottom, but the sides are so darn fluffy and the meat inside was piping hot and juicy delicious! I almost enjoyed these more than the soup dumplings themselves during this meal :oSoup Dumplings: I used to think these were the best soup dumplings, until Queens happened ahaha. But these are definitely in the Top 10, and the second best on the same block (Noodle Village takes the top in this area). Thin ass skin, but needs a little more soup for my tastes.Noodle Soup with Pork Chop: only bad thing is that this broth is just. so. bland. Noodles aren't the kind that I'm accustomed to so I didn't enjoy it as much. It's more starchy? Different taste, that's for sure. Pork chop was too dry. Pork and Bean Curd Soup: can't remember the exact name of the soup ordered but I just love soups and this one was really flavorful and hit the spot."
13,4 star rating,"We came here during the evening amidst all the corona virus talks that is spreading like wildfire in NYC. The place could not be any more vibrant and clean. The virus did not deter locals and new customers from coming to this establishment. With that being said, I am a huge fan of soup dumplings which is what gravitated me to coming here. The soup dumpling skin is quite thin but firm, so do not fret about it breaking! The soup was deliciously rich and not too salty. The pork/crab meat was not quite memorable. We also ordered the black truffle soup dumplings thinking it might somewhat resemble what we experienced at Din Tai Fung. The truffle was faint and honestly disappointing for what we paid for. I would avoid this dish if you are expecting Din Tai Fung quality.Give the soup dumplings a try. If that is not your cup of tea, there are over 50 other items on the menu ranging from authentic Shangainese dishes to regular traditional Chinese dishes."
14,4 star rating,"Excellent! I ordered delivery one night and it was so good. I had the Shanghai lo mein with chicken (it was full of flavor with a good mixture of veggies and chicken mixed into it), an order of their shrimp dumplings (juicy and delish) and scallion pancakes (yummy). Great portions too-plenty of leftover for one.I will have to stop by sometime for the full dine in experience!"
15,3 star rating,"I've been here a couple years back and decided to come here again recently. I feel like soup dumplings in the past were better made than the ones now. Came here around 5pm on a Sunday. The wait was about 15 -20 minutes.I decided to order pan fried noodles, pork dumplings and shrimp dumpling. The pan fried noodles was okay. It was a little too oily though. Large portion. The soup dumplings were ehhhh. What I didn't like about the experience was how the skin of the Soup Dumplings kept breaking when I tried to pick it up. It happened to all of them. In the past, the skin was thicker so it didn't break as easily. Since the skin broke, I didn't really have the ""real way of eating soup dumpling"" experience. Even though the skin broke, there were still some soup in the dumplings. Very flavorful and good. The soy sauce flavor was very strong. You don't need to add a lot of it to your food.Note: They only take cash or American Express."
16,2 star rating,"Got takeout from this place last night. My Shanghai style fried rice was very bland, reminded me of Panda Express. The rice was not even fried. It was basically white rice with some chicken, shrimp and vegetables. Our sweet and sour chicken had very little chicken in it. And the green peppers were uncooked. The soup dumplings were just ok. I've had better in Shanghai!. I would not try this place again."
17,5 star rating,"Despite of the pandemic outdoor eating, they have the best Xiao Long Bao in the city. So glad the quality is back. But it would be perfect if they don't use plastic containers for hot food."
18,4 star rating,"Such an amazing spot in china town! Comparable to the places I've been to in the Bay Area. We came on a Saturday around 1:30pm and there was still such a long line. It took around 40 minutes to get seated. The Pork XLB was SO GOOD, $6.25 for 6!! Juicy, thin skin, and the soup was so rich. Crab and pork XLB, $8.75 for 6. Not as good, a little fishy. Red oil wontons, $6.25 super spicy but so freakin' yummy. The oil adds such a nice touch Fried pork buns, $6.75 for 6. A little too doughy but overall good flavor. Very affordable, you can spend under $30 per person and be full here. I haven't had anything that topped this place in NYC! Must try."
19,4 star rating,"Very decent chinese restaurant in Chinatown! My friend and I got stirred fried water spinach with garlic ($13.50) and pepper steak ($17.50) to share along with two bowls of rice. The food came out pretty fast and both dishes were delicious. The pepper steak was so saucy and loaded with lots of veggies. It was just the right amount of sweet and savory flavor blended together! The meat was also soft and juicy that two of us finished everything. I know this place is known for their XLB too, so I would definitely want to come back here and try it. But honestly I might get the pepper steak dish again because it was so yummy. This is a cash only place and you probably have to wait in line on weekends, but it's worth it! They have several round tables, so it would also be fitting for big groups!"
20,5 star rating,"We came here on a Friday at around 2pm and there was about a 20 minute wait for 2- and it was definitely worth it. This place is awesome!We started with the pork soup dumplings and black truffle soup dumplings, both of which were amazing. Every bite was bursting with flavor (literally). While the black truffle was delicious, I don't think it was worth twice the cost of the regular pork soup dumplings, so I probably would just go with regular pork next time.The shanghai spring rolls were very good, as was the kung pao chicken and the pork fried rice. The serving sizes are generous, so come home hungry! Cash or Amex only."
21,4 star rating,"Even in Covid they deliver service, quality, and restrooms!Friendly helpful wait staff, friendly management, and clean restrooms you are welcome to use!There are some restaurants that can learn from them in courtesy, friendliness, and customer service! To them the spoils of first time customers who like learning the hard way but for me, if a place disses me or I don't feel treated like a paying customer with decency and gratitude there are plenty of other businesses for me to take my money to and tell others about.You are fortunate if you are reading this for this is one place I recommend for Chinese food during Covid. the prices are decent, portions are fair or ample depending on the dish.We had Shrimp and Chicken in Hoisen Sauce (I enjoyed it and had lots of mushrooms - not quite my fav); and Beef pan fried noodles (very crispy and mixed chinese vegetables. Slightly bland but okay for those on low sodium diet). Thai Iced tea was good.They do not serve cups of water. You must purchase their bottled water or bring your own.Service is on thick cardboard paper plates and brought to you in take out containers instead of on plates. Chop sticks are wrapped in pairs in sealed plastic, and forks and spoons are standard cheap plastic. Not an image for a first date you seek to impress but what would you expect in NYC during covid and in a community that is hyper cautious in preventing spread and contagion.Round grilled picnic tables.Composite clean raised flooring so you are not on the street nor have to look at or think about it.Bordered on street with wall of live bushes in raised planters (bottom is wooden wall).Each seating area separated by plexiglass divider to prevent spread from other table section.Handicap accessible.Bon Appetite,Carson"
22,5 star rating,"Great food. Clean, efficient and employees care about what they do. With the weather getting cooler, I hope they install a warming apparatus to accommodate outdoor dining. Will be dining at Shanghai 21 within next two weeks."
23,4 star rating,I wanted to try Soup Dumplings so looked for a place that served them in Chinatown. When I got there around 1 pm I had to wait about 10 minutes. I ordered Soup Dumplings with crab meat and pork. There were six of them. I ate the first one and the soup was hot and it was delicious. After a few of them the soup was getting colder. I prefer hot. I also ordered Beef with Tofu from Over Rice sexton. I expected a different dish but it was still good.
24,4 star rating,"Cash only! Not as busy as Joe's Shanghai and it's a more intimate setting. Your party will have their own table, if that's something that bothers you about Joe's Shanghai. I came here to also try their pork soup dumplings and I was impressed! You get 6 pieces and each one was filled with delicious soup. While Joe's is thicker and more savory, Shanghai Cafe's soup dumplings have a lighter, cleaner broth. DO NOT just bite into the soup dumplings. You gotta drink the soup first, it's all part of the experience. We also got to try their Pan Fried spork Dumplings, which came with 6 pieces. Not bad but they didn't stand out as much as the soup dumplings. You get more for your money at Joe's Shanghai but Shanghai Cafe's soup dumplings are up to par!"
25,4 star rating,"This place always seems to be busy. We came here and found out that there was a pretty long wait, so we skipped. Fast forward a month later, we came back and found out the wait was only 15 mins or so, so we waited.This restaurant is located at the corner of Mott st and Mosco st, in Chinatown. I saw the Yelp reviews and they were plentiful and for the most part pretty good.We ordered a good amount of food, so I feel like I got a good sampling. We shared the kung pao chicken, beef pan fried noodles, pan fried dumplings, and the soup dumplings.I actually like both dumplings, slightly preferring the pan fried over the soup dumplings. The portion sizes of the kung pao and pan fried noodles were on the large side. It was actually quite a bit of food. Everything I tried that day was very good."
26,4 star rating,"I ordered the Buddha's delight via Seamless as it seemed like a safe bet as far as being vegetarian. The tofu &amp; vegetables in the dish were all perfectly cooked, and the rice that accompanied the dish was fluffy and plentiful. I would prefer the dish to be a little bit more flavorful, it was mainly just soy sauce &amp; sodium. That being said, if you're a vegetarian looking to satisfy a craving for Chinese, I would say that the dish will have you covered."
27,5 star rating,"DUMPLINGS!  Delicious.  Delectable.  Delightful.  Dangerous... because once you order them, you can't stop.  I think this is a great contender to the infamous soup dumplings from Joe's Shanghai.  In fact, I think I would be as so bold to say-and bold I righteously am-that they are better here at Shanghai 21!  YES!!!The broth is packed with flavour and the quality of the dumpling itself, from the dainty wrapper to the filling inside, is impeccable.  Yeah, we're using big words here because I really do think it's that amazing.  I've had both the crab meat &amp; pork dumplings and the black truffle dumplings and enjoyed both.  Tremendously.  The black truffle dumplings have a slight truffle flavour and isn't too overpowering, just enough to let you know that it's there. The other dumplings that deserve some recognition here, which are not of the soup variety, are the shrimp dumplings (ha cao).  OMG.  The best I've ever had, even better than any dim sum place could serve.  They are HUGE and look so perfect sitting in the basket.  The wrapper is translucent enough so that you can see the pink flesh of the shrimp.  Perfectly plump.  Make sure to drizzle some of the sauce they give you because it elevates the flavour to another dimension... sublime.  Chef's Kiss to this dumpling because I think it might be the item I would choose to eat before my last moments on this Earth. Worth the wait if you come here and it's packed!!!"
28,5 star rating,"I'm obsessed with this place. My friend and I went for dinner, and the wait wasn't terrible. However, be careful because during dinner time the list can get kind of annoying, so just be sure to come on the earlier side. This restaurant is super accessible by train, and it's in a very bustling area of Chinatown which is nice if you want dessert or just to walk around after eating. Service is super fast and efficient too. The portions are super generous and the food was super affordable, and my friend and I barely finished everything.FOOD:Xiao long bao (5/5) - These soup dumplings were divine. I recommend getting one order of the original pork ones just to get a taste of a classic done right. The dumpling wraps were clearly handmade and very thin, perfect for soup dumplings. Truffle Xiao long bao (5/5) - Oh my god. You HAVE to get these soup dumplings. I've had the Din Tai Fung truffle xiao long bao, and this dish blew that one out of the water. These are probably the best soup dumplings I've ever had. Enoki mushrooms and watercress (5/5) - This was a super unique dish. The sauce on the enoki mushrooms was the perfect amount of savory and the combo of greens and mushrooms was delicious. Shanghai rice cakes (4.5/5) - This was the least impressive dish of the bunch but was still delicious. It's a classic Shanghainese plate, and was very good. The sauce was a little unevenly coated on the cakes but the rice cakes were chewy and cooked to perfection."
29,4 star rating,"Shanghai 21 was surprisingly very good! When we got there, we told the man a table for 2 and he said it would be a 20 minute wait so we waited outside but they called my name after 5 minutes! We were seated and after a few minutes no one had come to us and I noticed that others just had to flag down the hostess and servers. The manager saw me and told a server to come to our table. We ordered our food and it came out quickly. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, plain steamed buns (it came with evaporated milk - yum!), pan-fried potstickers, sesame chicken over rice, and low mein with pork and shrimp. It was all so good! The sauce for the sesame chicken was great and I wish I took the leftover sauce to go! It was so good. The prices were great considering it's in NYC. My boyfriend and I are definitely coming back here. Service: 3.5 stars since we had to flag them down but food came out really quick!Food: 5 stars!"
30,5 star rating,"After coming here multiple times and pretty much ordering the same dish at each visit, I decided it was high time to write a review for it. To start off, this place is usually packed, expect a long wait or come at odd times - it is worth it. The waiters are very friendly and won't rush you to order. The dishes we get every time are the xiao long bao, wonton szechuan style, cold sliced pork leg, hot and sour soup, crispy fried salt and pepper squid, and crispy seafood noodle. My personal favorite is the sliced pork leg. I've only had this particular delicacy once in my childhood at Foxwoods and since then I had been on a quest to find them. Imagine my surprise when I finally found them at this place. They are sliced very thin and served cold with a mildly spicy and sour sauce. The gelatinous fat and tender meat are a match made in heaven. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for their Shanghainese fix - it definitely gives Joe's Shanghai a run for their money!"
31,4 star rating,"we were so excited to try this spotwe got some of the soup dumplings beef and broccoli and black pepper fish to goeverything was very flavorfuland cooked perfectlyeven to-go, the food was piping hotand delicious"
32,4 star rating,"This is the spot for the best Shanghai food in Chinatown. Always hot green tea waiting on the table. The food is delicious. The meat pie is pretty good, same with some of the chow mein dishes. I will be going back regularly."
33,5 star rating,"Favorite spot for soup dumplings, very clean tasting nothing too fatty when it comes to the broth. And best noodles with meat sauce."
34,5 star rating,"Let's call this a Dumpling Daze. I devoured the pork soup dumplings, the black truffle soup dumplings, and the shrimp dumplings in under six minutes. Sat next to the playground nearby and have no idea who was around me and what the kids did and what day it was and if the sun was shining but OH YOU CAN BET I know how great these dumplings were as I soared through a world of luxurious, rich, fresh flavors that need no soy sauce, no ginger, no nothing. Just perfect as they are. The founder of the dumplings-themed Instagram DumplingGang recommended this place to me and, well, she's a pro who knows her dumplings. I'll be raving about these from here on out. Cannot wait to come back for a straight-up dim sum meal.5 stars!!!!!!!"
35,5 star rating,One of my favorite dim sum experiences besides China...It was between this and another super popular place but I was glad a came here.  I came in with one other person on a weekday and was seated immediately.  Our waiter gave some great recommendations and even helped answer some questions.  They menu was pretty extensive and had a lot of options.  They even had a Specials menu for the day which we also got some items from.  We ended up getting quite a few things but one of my favorites included their Szechuan Style Spicy Wontons and their Black Truffle Soup Dumplings.  Both were so good I am unsure which I prefer more.  I highly recommend both.  You must try them!!!  The Szechuan Style dumplings are great if you love spicy and a little sweet.  The sauce it came in was so good the person I came with would use the other dumplings with it.  The black truffle soup dumplings had the strong smell of truffles which I loved and tasted full of it.  Yummy!  We ordered their pickled cucumbers off the daily special which went great with everything.The service was excellent.  Our server was nice and took care of us.  The food came fast and the restaurant even takes AmEx!!!  I was so glad we came here and recommend it.  You will not disappointed if you love dim sum.
36,2 star rating,"We ordered soup dumplings and an order of bean curds with black mushrooms with extra chicken for takeout. The soup dumplings were great, same as when we dined in frequently before covid19. However, after leaving the premise to eat the food, we discovered that we were given a dish of bok choy with shitake mushrooms with an extra topping of chicken instead of the dish I ordered. It's fine that it was probably honest mistake. But the chicken tasted bad like it was added as an afterthought. I didn't like the shitake mushrooms or the bok choy. The sauce wasn't good either. I'm disappointed that I got a wrong order with takeout. Too bad we were far off from the restaurant to let them know."
37,4 star rating,"Yum!!! Best soup dumpling I've had in Chinatown! This is definitely the place to go if you're not feeling a trek to flushings! The soup dumplings are larger than normal sized, so don't be alarmed that the servings come in 6 rather than 8 at some places. Each dumpling is packed with so much soup! And the dumpling skin is the perfect thinness, not too chewy and doughy at all. I truly enjoyed the pork soup dumplings. We also ordered the crab meat soup dumplings and those come with a ball of crabmeat at the center of a pork soup dumpling! Yum! I wouldn't order anything but the soup dumplings here though. The Kao fu we ordered was drenched in soy sauce and SO SALTY, and the wood ear lacked fresh crunch (kinda smooshy) Service was quick, they even let us switch to a table near the outlets for phone charging purposes! Only had to wait Less than 10 min on a Saturday prime lunch time. 5 stars for soup dumpling, 3 stars for other foods."
38,4 star rating,"Come here for the dumplings and then order all the dumplings. My dad, husband and I came here on a Thursday night after a holiday party, and were immediately seated. We tried two varieties of dumplings: Soup Dumpling with Pork and the Black Truffle Soup Dumpling with Pork. Both were fantastic - thin skin, flavorful broth and a tasty ball of pork. I would recommend the black truffle only if you really like the taste of truffle. For mains we shared the braised boar hock with baby bok choy, and the Shanghai style lo main with beef. Both were excellent. The braised boar hock is pretty fatty and filling, and I'd only recommend to more ""open"" eaters. Pro Tips:- Come for the dumplings. Order all the dumplings. - Good for groups and walk-ins"
39,4 star rating,"Came back two years after the first time I visited, and still really like this place, IMO one of the best restaurants in Chinatown. No frills, brisk service, and they only take cash or Amex."
40,5 star rating,Black truffle xiao long bao is my go-to menu along with golden enoki mushroom. It just taste sooooo good!
41,5 star rating,You know how you strive to find the perfect soup dumpling? The one with the perfect amount of soup and filling? This is it! The Crap and Pork Soup Dumpling is perfection. The soup itself is flavorful the filling is just right and once popped in your mouth you realize all your dumpling dreams have come true. At around 8 dollars it was definitely worth the price. The complimentary hot tea is nice as well especially in this cold weather. There may be a wait being a smaller restaurant but I think it's worth it!
42,4 star rating,"This is my third (or perhaps fourth) time here, however first time reviewing this spot. Came with my mom on Wednesday at 7pm. Restaurant was pretty full, but the staff managed to sat us down for a meal. We ordered four dishes: fried squid, crab soup dumplings, bamboo shoots, and preserved cabbage and shredded meat noodles. Total bill came about $36 tax and tip not included. Not a bad deal for 2 people.PROS:Bamboo shoots were out of the world! As a classic Shanghainese dish, they did not fail to impress here! The sauce was very mild, and the shoots themselves very soft and tender. You can tell it was marinated for quite a long time. Fried squid was crispy, seasoned very well, and tasted very fresh, and the portion sizes were quite big! I really enjoyed that dish alot.Soup dumplings were definitely flavorful! A little bit on the pricier side of things since we were given only 6 dumplings (usually its 8) at $8.25 a basket. However, you can taste the crab roe/meat inside as it adds a lot of flavor to the dumplings, and there was a voluminous amount of soup in each dumplings. Meat was very tender, juicy, and fresh.CONS:Our noodles dish, while portions were big, tasted very bland. Usually in Shanghai you get a TON of preserved cabbage in your noodles, however I felt the ratio was off between noodles and cabbage/meat. Also, the soup tasted a little lackluster in flavor, making the noodles taste a little bland and soggy.OVERALL:Some hits, some misses. Overall was quite impressed with the food served at Shanghai 21. Not the best Shanghainese restaurant around the block, but it sure is a good option to have if you're around the area."
43,5 star rating,"The food here is actually the best. All the servers are nice, and waiting didn't take very long. So many people line up for this place. It's crazy! I recommend the soup dumplings and Sichuan wontons. I will definitely come again."
44,5 star rating,"If We could rate Shanghai 21 more than five stars We would!Great place for date night. Even though it was really crowded and a little noisy, it still felt intimate. We visited on a Friday night around 7:30 pm. The wait time for 2 people was about 35-40 minutes. While waiting, more and more people started coming in and the wait time increased to an hour! We thought to ourselves, if people are willing to wait an hour, the food is definitely worth it and indeed, it was!When we were seated we got a complimentary teapot with Jasmine tea. We ordered the Szechuan Style Wontons, soup dumplings with pork, and the black truffle soup dumplings with pork as our starters.The wontons were a little spicy but very flavorful and delicious. The soup dumplings are indescribable but we will do our best to describe them. Just 1 word, AMAZING!! It was cooked to perfection, the flavorful broth did not drain out of the dumplings. It was like a Shanghainese party in your mouth bursting with flavor lol. They were also VERY reasonably priced. We then ordered a general tso chicken and a side order of Sauteed Baby Shanghai Bai Choy which were both very delicious. We are both dumpling fanatics so we highly recommend this restaurant if you're in Chinatown and want to chow down on some good dumplings."
45,4 star rating,"This place is always quite crowded whenever I pass by, so I've been dissuaded from going. However, today, I had a friend wait in line for me so I didn't need to wait for too long.One thing to note is that this place is not a dim sum place - there aren't carts going around and the interior isn't the most spacious. There are giant magnified pictures of the food on the wall, in case you can't see the food on your own table well enough.We ordered truffle soup dumplings, pork and crab soup dumplings, and rice cake with pork and preserved vegetables. My favorite was definitely the standard pork and crab soup dumplings - they were really flavorful and almost sweet. They were also the first thing I had and I was incredibly hungry. The truffle soup dumplings were a little bit of a letdown - definitely not worth the $13 or so price, and I got tired of them midway through the 2nd one. Not bad to try with a group of friends, but I probably wouldn't get again. The rice cake was delicious, and was a good amount of food, perfect to share with two people! Also a fair price. In the future, I would probably try out the shanghainese noodles, and save some money without the truffle xiao long baos. All in all, a pretty solid experience."
46,4 star rating,"Great Shanghainese place with big portions! Fyi the bowl of rice is HUGE.Been here twice, came out stuffed twice too lol. Here's the rundown!Scallion pancakesCrisp, almost no filling. I would skip this, I've had much better elsewhere.Pork soup dumplings / XLBPretty good! Doesn't have that porky smell/taste if you know what I mean. If I remember correctly, skin is thicker than average but it's ok it protects the yummy juices.Chicken corn soupGood, great when you're starving and can't wait for the mains lol.Chicken or beef stir fried rice cakeSo good!! If you don't have food restrictions, it tastes better with beef. The slices of beef are very tender. The rice cakes are nice and chewy. There's some vegetables also so you can pretend it's healthy ;)Shi jin guo ba (assorted meat potage with sizzling rice)Nice surprise! It comes with squares of crispy rice and they pour the sauce with the goodies on your table. The sauce is orangy and couldn't place my finger on it but this is great!Wu xi spare ribs Soy based tender pork ribs, loved by my picky brother.Watercress and enoki mushroomsYum! A refreshing break from the heavy saucy stuffGarlic eggplantDelicious! Eggplant slices were nice and tender and sauce was flavorful. Be careful as this may burn your mouth!Crispy duckDo not get this. It was dry and hard and surprisingly disappointing given how great the other food were."
47,5 star rating,"Some of the best dumplings I've ever had! Stopped by with some friends and we munched on a bunch of em. We had 2 orders of the black truffle, crabmeat XLB's, pan fried pork dumplings, Cantonese hot and sour soup, Szechuan wonton dumplings. Flavors here are on point and definitely authentic. These dumplings are perfect in size and are delicious. The black truffle was amazing and has some rich flavor. The hot and sour soup is super spicy. The wonton dumplings look super hot, but they definitely were on the mild side. I'll mark this place down as a must visit from now on as the quality of dumplings here are at another level. The restaurant itself is kept pretty clean despite it being in Chinatown. Highly recommend this place if you're craving XLB's or some authentic Shanghainese dishes."
48,4 star rating,"Surprisingly good Xiao Long Bao. ...as for the other stuff we tried, the Taiwanese style porkchop was also pretty good, and the other stuff more in the average category).in fact, i would rate the xaio long bao up there with the best in terms of quality of meat, flavor, juiciness and thin quality wrap.the ONLY place they may fall short of the very best anywhere in appearance, and just slightly thicker at the top of the bun than the elite.they don't quite have that perfect, neat, presentation of the elite buns.but man, if you more concerned with taste, juiciness and quality than perfect presentation, you will not be disappointed with Shanghai 21 !This now makes only 2 ""acceptable"" xaio long bao places I've found in Manhattan (out of around 2 dozen I've sampled on Manhattan island. - the other good place being The Bao in East Village. Expanding out geographically, I like Kung Fu Xaio Long Bao in flushing as my #1 pick, in spite of the awful service (not to be confused with the unrelated Kung Fu Xaio Long Bao in uptown Manhattan, which is not one of my top picks).my overall top few picks for the ny area (including all 3 major NY Chinatowns - flushing, Brooklyn and Manhattan) are as follows:1. Kung Fu in flushing 2. The Bao (east village)3. Tie - Little Dumpling (Little Neck), and Shanghai 21 (Manhattan)4. Nan Xin Xiang Xaio Long Bao (flushing - temporarily closed due to moving).Beyond these, the other NY ones I've tried have more obvious flaws, like thicker wraps, less juice, poor flavor, lower quality meat, such ad with gristle, etc.Many are still good, but just not as good. ...and some are flat out bad.Also note that my xiao long bao rankings ate just that - and not overall restaurant rankings. for example, while i rate the xaio long bao at Kung Fu much above flushing rival Nan Xiang, i would still prefer Nan Xiang if your with a group and after more variety of quality dishes. A good thing about Shanghai 21 is that it is also a good choice for other dishes besides xaio long bao, plus a pleasant interior environment.   however, when choosing, make sure to include the xaio long bao as one of the dishes !"
49,5 star rating,"The truffle soup dumplings are AMAZING, seriously the best soup dumplings I've ever had."
50,5 star rating,"I've been coming here with friends for a couple of years now, and their soup dumplings are consistently good. They don't take reservations and the wait can be long sometimes but the quality is well worth the wait. The service is pretty quick as well.The XLB skin is thin but filled with hot and flavorful filling and soup. It's perfect by itself or with vinegar and ginger which is always served on the side. They also have black truffle XLB which I have not tried yet, but smell sooo good. I also really love the pan fried noodles and the fried pork buns. The buns are super soft and the meat is savory. Like most restaurants in Chinatown, it's cash only but they do accept Amex. Overall, I highly recommend coming here if you've never tried their XLB!"
51,4 star rating,"Stopped by as we were exploring Chinatown for a light lunch. While the restaurant was busy, we were able to get seated immediately and were served complimentary green tea. I thought that the overall quality of the food was great. I really enjoyed the soup dumplings with pork - the broth was very flavorful. We also ordered the Szechuan Style wontons, which was a bit too sweet and not spicy enough for my taste."
52,2 star rating,"Came here for a date on Saturday morning and it was thankfully not super packed. Although when we left, it was starting to get very crowded. The ambiance of this place is nice and they take American Express (no other cards) and cash only. The service was pretty fast and good. We came and got an order of fried dumplings, soup dumplings and the Shanghainese fried noodles. The fried dumplings came in an order of 6 for $6.50ish. They were OK. The soup dumplings came in an order for 6 for about the same price so not that bad. The meat though for both dumplings tasted sour. I don't know what it was but it really turned me off. I couldn't finish the food and I always finish food. The Shanghai noodles though were very good. They were like lo mein noodles but fried with a nice sauce and gravy on top. There was a hefty portion of meat which was nice. Overall, an OK place, but those dumplings really made me nervous eating here again."
53,5 star rating,My friend from Luxembourg came to visit and wanted to try a place in Chinatown and I had no ideas. We stumbled upon this little restaurant and I already can't wait to go back. Their pork soup dumplings were delicious. I loved their udon dish and the eggplant dish was so good I'm trying to google recipes so I can learn to make it myself. The food was fresh and the place was really busy for lunch on a Sunday.
54,4 star rating,"I know this place from back when it was still called Shanghai Manor, so I was excited to see what had changed and more importantly, what had stayed (hopefully the quality!).Saturday late afternoon proved to still be a busy time, and we were promised a table in 30 minutes when we arrived at 2:30 PM. The wait was shorter, and we were seated and given tea.Looking around, it seemed like the only thing that changed was the name - the decor, the servers, the uniforms, the colour scheme were all the same. Perusing through the menu, I realised my partner's allergies might be a point of contention for a Chinese establishment - he's allergic to mushrooms, which is used in 75% of our dishes.When the waiter came, I gave them the notice and they made good on their promise when our food arrived. We got two Shanghai soup dumplings (pork only), a Shanghai Lo Mein with Shrimp and Beef, and an order of Bok Choy. The food came relatively quickly, but I was a bit disappointed that ""no mushrooms"" meant the bok choy would literally come as is - steamed, but no flavour to it. The soup dumplings were just as good as I remembered them, but I do think the wrapped could have been more thin. The soup and meat itself was still very savoury and delicious without being overpowering, The Shanghai Lo Mein was made just as it should have - slippery and juicy with just enough grease.Overall, it was a good experience and I'm glad to know this Chinatown staple is still up and running, but I think I need to ditch the mushroom-averse friends before coming next time."
55,5 star rating,"I've been on some dumpling kick for the past couple months and have been going around EVERYWHERE trying to find some bomb dumplings. We ordered the soup dumplings, the fried pork bun and the salt and pepper pork chops. The soup dumplings were decent, nothing TOO special. The fried pork bun was the true winner. So crispy at the bottom yet the bun itself is SO FLUFFY. The only thing I wished was that there could be more meat inside. The salt and pepper pork chops were super yummy and crispy!! It wasn't too salty which is the problem with most places. Definitely want to come again and try the truffle xiao long bao!!"
56,5 star rating,"My two friends and I came here on a Saturday night for dinner around 6. We seemed to had come right before the rush as our wait time was only 30 minutes. By the time we were seated the queue time was over an hour wait. Despite the long queue, the staff was very attentive to us and didn't make us feel rushed to order or pay. Hearing many good things about their soup dumplings we wanted to try them for ourselves. We got all three types, the pork, the pork and crab, and the black truffle. Which were all priced reasonably. Their soup dumplings definitely lived up to the hype and were incredibly flavorful and delicious. The black truffle was definitely the best out of the three types, with the pork and pork and crab equally as good. We also ordered the shrimp lo mein which was nothing special but very good as well.Would definitely recommend this place for their soup dumplings."
57,5 star rating,"This is literally my favorite place for shanghainese food in Chinatown. They have all the homey and familiar dishes associated with Shanghai like soup dumplings, wide fried noodles, and the rice cakes with preserved veg and pork, their mapo tofu (which also comes in a meatless version) is so much better tasting that most joints around town that claim to sell 'mapo tofu' but are really just selling lies. The prices are fair and there's often a line. Cash or AMEX only."
58,4 star rating,A most loved spot for quality Chinese food. Dropped in on Tues. I anticipate an arrival trip. The bill won't stun you. Menu is like a café in Jacksonville I enjoyed.
59,5 star rating,"Can not say enough about Shanghai 21, it is truly a gem of Chinatown.  The long line is worth putting your name on a list and waiting for a table, I promise.  We ordered hot &amp; sour soup, chicken corn soup, scallion pancakes, pork and crab soup dumplings and pork soup dumplings, steamed pork buns, and chicken &amp; eggplant in garlic sauce. The food was authentic, and so flavorful.  We didn't have one bad thing!  It was my first time trying chicken corn soup and now i'm a fan! DO NOT SKIP on the eggplant in garlic sauce, its easily one of my favorite dishes, and Shanghai 21 makes it better than anywhere else.  If you're in the area, and looking for AUTHENTIC food, this is better than other popular restaurants in the area!! Can't wait to go back."
60,5 star rating,"Wow! This place is definitely a gem. The customers were super nice and were welcoming. We ordered a lot for the 5 of us and overall the food was amazing. We of course had to order the soup dumplings, the Shanghainese styled fried noodles, the dongpo rou, chicken, vegetables, and another dish that I totally forgot the name of!! But all the dishes were pretty authentic and I definitely recommend checking this place out! Although, there was a slight mishap where we ordered another round of soup dumplings and they just never brought it out, which was fine by us. We just went on and paid the bill."
61,4 star rating,"The best soup dumplings in all of Chinatown. Their other items are good, but do not hold a candle to their dumplings. Come here for the soup dumplings, but if you must have an actual entree, I recommend the Zha Jiang Mian or the Fried Noodles."
62,4 star rating,"Had a better experience this time around. Waited about an hour during peak brunch time but my friend and I went to Kam Hing for a snack in the meantime, so it wasn't too bad. We shared:+ black truffle pork soup dumplings+ fried tiny buns+ scallion pancake+ pork soup dumplingsThe truffle dumplings were definitely the standout, and the scallion pancake was still perfect. Service was good and we were able to use a credit card (Amex or cash only)."
63,3 star rating,Ok food. Kinda sweet( Typical Shanghainese?) They ONLY. accept AMEX... like wtf. ???
64,4 star rating,This is the first time intro Shanghainese cuisine yet it gave me some disappointed/upset about my orders..the sauce for the fish is not tasty enough..too sweet..and the fish is not big for 2  people..Thank you
65,4 star rating,Kung Pao chicken.Get it. Maybe two plates of it.It is the best thing I was able to try when I was here.The interior is pretty spacious for this area. The food was good and the service was just enough.And you get ALOT of food for your dollar. I also liked the sesame noodles and the soup dumplings.4/5
66,5 star rating,"Best XLB and small pan fried buns so far. More expensive than other places but the flavors are on point.Regular XLB 6 for $6.50. No over powering ginger taste, tender skin, and tons of soup. Pan fried buns ($6.25) not as big, glorious, or flavorful as the ones you get in Asia that are bursting with soup and meat but on point with the crispy bottoms and juicy filling. Five spice beef ($9.25) came with pickled cabbage. Goes great as a standalone with beer or with a bowl of rice. Shanghai style Lo Mein ($9.95) was good. Highly recommend Shanghai 21. Not to be confused with all the other places with Shanghai and 21 in their names, this place does it right even though it's a little more expensive. Clean interior, great service, Amex or cash accepted only, they don't charge for tea."
67,5 star rating,"Soup dumplings are a WILD experience, and I'm very glad I had that experience. Delicious, weird, and incredibly affordable. Chicken fried rice was also great -- I never finish fried rice and I did here. Slight wait, but nothing outrageous for lunch. Love that they carry Coke products."
68,3 star rating,"The dumplings were okay. There was not enough soup in the dumplings to be considered a soup dumpling. Some of them had popped too but to be fair, soup dumplings are not great for take out."
69,5 star rating,"Cozy and familiar feeling. Food was on point. We got squid, dan dan noodles and a bunch of xlbs. dan dan noodles did come out a bit differently than I expected but it was still really good. I really liked this place and would come again!"
70,5 star rating,"When I go to Chinatown I always come here if I can. They sometimes have a long wait but it's worth it if you can wait. I enjoy their dishes and they recently renovated so the space is slightly bigger than before. The only accept American Express if you're using a credit card, otherwise bring cash for sure! I always get my staples at this place: definitely one order of their soup dumplings. Personally think this place has one of the best. Their wu xi spiced spares ribs. And if they have watercress in season then definitely that. You can't go wrong with any of their dishes so be adventurous!"
71,4 star rating,"There was a short line outside of the restaurant at 11:00AM on Saturday. Everyone was seated with several open tables left in the restaurant. Service - Sweet, nice, friendly.Interior - Warm, simple.Crab and pork dumplings - Probably my favorite XLB. It was juicy, plump, and gushing with soup. The dumpling skin was soft and soggy and the perfect thickness.Black truffle soup dumplings with pork - Where's the truffle? Pass.Salty and fresh pork medley with dry bean curd tripe and bamboo shoot - Flavorful, savory, and saucy. Portions look large but easy for one very hungry adult to finish with room for dessert."
72,4 star rating,"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night with my family. I've walked past this place several times and every time there's at least a 30 minute wait and of course, I wanted to see what all the fuss is about! The menu is quite extensive and we ordered an assortment of dishes including xiaolongbao, sheng jian bao, and nian gao, all the cornerstone Chinese dishes. The sheng jian bao could've used some more cook time cause they were a little too bread-y, not fried enough. The nian gao has great texture but was a little lacking on flavor. Overall everything was pretty good and the food came out really quickly."
73,5 star rating,"My favorite Chinese place in the city! I recommend this place to anyone goin got Chinatown. The wait is never ridiculously long (20-30 mins at most) and I've never seen this place empty. The food is tasty and filling; my personal favorites are the noodles with meat sauce and soup dumplings (both pictured). Shanghai 21 used to be called shanghai Asia manor. They do only accept cash and Amex, so be sure to stop by the ATM before. I'd say it's relatively cheap, even for chinese!"
74,4 star rating,"Good spot for chinese food, especially for soup dumplings.The Scallion Pancakes were so light and crispy and not greasy at all! Salt &amp; Pepper Squid also had a great texture and the portion size was pretty big. The soup dumplings were a good size and the broth was tasty.**CASH OR AMERICAN EXPRESS ONLY**Service was quick &amp; friendly."
75,4 star rating,We came on a Sunday night where they was a long wait. The service could have been better as they were busy with only two people taking orders. We waited about 10 minutes before we ordered. The food  came out fast and was delicious. Will come back again.
76,5 star rating,Wow! Best soup dumplings ever! I ate here on vacation from San Diego. Din thai Fung has great soup dumplings but this place has the best. Will not disappoint!
77,3 star rating,"Let me say this has been my FAVORITE joint for soup dumplings.However I unfortunately have to share my unpleasant experience- last nights order I found a thick metal ring in my lo-mein pork-shrimp noodles (never going to order that again) It was so hard it could have cracked my tooth. Which is terrifying. To have the metal ring in my mouth was beyond shocking - the metal wasn't a small one. However once I called and complained they were very gracious &amp; accommodating, they sent me 2 more dishes of my choice (soup dumplings &amp; shrimp chive dumplings ) on the house &amp; it was delivered very quickly! (ps- personally I'd just stick to the soup dumplings &amp; regular dumplings) that never disappoints &amp; that's what is the best. Shanghai 21 - I've been your biggest fan for your food- but it's so disappointing to have such a horrible / scary experience- please do a better job in your maintenance &amp; reputation."
78,5 star rating,"This is a tiny restaurant so on the weekends can get very crowded and the wait can be very  long, but is worth the wait. They have a variety of dim sums everything i had was very very good, the service was good and the food came right out. Parking is  on the street by the way."
79,4 star rating,"Dumplings and more dumplings please!  Came here on an early weekend afternoon and was surprisingly seated right away.  Must have been perfect timing because the line was really hopping by the time we left.  Dumplings are excellent.  Soup dumplings, har gao, siu mai... they were all fresh and excellent.  Also ordered some noodles which were chewy and on point.  Service is quick and efficient.  Quick note that they only accept Amex if using plastic instead of cash!"
80,5 star rating,"Mmmm soup dumplings! This place doesn't get as much credit as it deserves since Joes Shanghai seems so much more popular. We tried the truffle soup dumplings and the Shanghai noodles.The truffle soup dumplings were soooo good! The dumplings came out hot, flavor was delicious and the broth was clear. I especially loved the broth because it tasted cleaner than Joes Shanghai (the broth was kinda murky/cloudy from the pork). Not sure if it tasted that much better because truffle was added, but I doubt it. I really regret not ordering the regular soup dumplings to compare to Joes Shanghai, but we were so full from everything else we ate during the trip. The Shanghai noodles were tasty too. Kinda oily but that's how it usually is. The noodles kind of had a chewy texture (how it should be) so it was good. Definitely want to come back again!"
81,5 star rating,"So I've been coming to this JOINT for 6 plus years now and it NEVER FAILS!!!!!! It's to the point when I call in everyone knows my order, I literally have a weekly pick up lol..Need I say more?! I DONT THINK SO!"

83,5 star rating,"My new favorite place for soup dumplings!  13 year old and I had been eying Shanghai Asian Manor for some time and we are so glad we finally tried it!  It is a nicer and cleaner than Joe's Shanghai and the food truly rocked!13 year old and I shared a feast which included two types of Soup Dumplings (Crab &amp; Pork and Black Truffle). Both types were so tasty with the perfect texture and plenty of soup inside each dumpling. The Black Truffle Dumplings were twice the price as the regular ones but they had such a unique flavor that they were worth it!We also ordered one of the specialties of the house, the Fried Tiny Buns with Pork. The buns were puffed like a cloud but had the nicest crisp too!   Noodles with Pork and Shrimp rounded out our meal.  Made with plenty of shrimp and greens, this dish was delicious and we ate every last drop. Our food came out very quickly. We did have to wait about 15 minutes for a table at lunch time which we would do again!"

85,4 star rating,"Shanghai 21's food is solid! Their host was friendly but the rest of their staff did not seem the most enthusiastic. Nonetheless, their food was tasty and service was fast. We came in on Veteran's day for dinner - although the restaurant was filled, we only had to wait 10 minutes before our party of 4 was seated. When eating Shanghainese food, you have to get the soup dumplings! We got their pork soup dumplings (aka xiao long bao) - flavor was good and I would say the size of them were slightly larger than the regular. So if you're the type who likes to have it all in one bite, it might be slightly more difficult.However, what I liked more than the XLBs were their pan fried soup dumplings (shen jian bao's). These were absolutely delicious - they were piping hot, bottom was pan fried to perfect crispiness, and flavor was bomb! I would recommend getting these! We also got their beef fried rice cakes which had great flavor and the rice cakes were cooked to just the right chewiness. Definitely give these two dishes a go if you come here!"
86,4 star rating,"Best soup dumplings I've ever had. Giving it 4 stars because they delivery usually takes long and there's always a wait, but it's worth it! There are a few dishes i could do without, but their soup dumplings are to die for. The crispy shredded beef is AMAZING! Thank me lat"
87,4 star rating,"Regular soup dumplings are the best! It has a lot of juice inside and is very tasty! Soup dumpling with crab meat is amazing! The seafood smell is well immersed in the dumpling. Highly recommend if you like seafood! The water crest shrimp dumplings are average, the filling is a bit dry, and the taste is very interesting. It is unique, but I am not a big fan of the watercrest filling. The fried tiny buns with pork is alright, not bad, just nothing stand out. The bottom is well and evenly fried.  There is always a wait at the door. And they ONLY accept American Express card or Cash!!!!!"
88,4 star rating,"Get the TRUFFLE SOUP DUMPLINGS. These are the star of the show and the main reason why this restaurant gets so much buzz. I would also say their Szechuan style dumplings / wontons and pork dumplings are good as well. Come here for those items, but everything else is just ""ok."" For example, we ordered the fried rice and it was pretty bad..needed a lot more flavor or maybe just a little bit of soy sauce? so pro tip, just stick to the soup dumplings and things like it."
89,5 star rating,"My favorite place to go for dumplings! It is really cheap! Food is great! Service is awesome! The food come out quick after you order! They are very friendly as well.

90,5 star rating,"Great takeout option -- I love the noodle soups, wonton bc appetizer, &amp; sesame chicken. The scallion pancakes were only so so but overall it's fast, well priced, and delicious"
91,5 star rating,"They will take cash AND American Express (over $20!). As someone who never carries cash and happens to have Amex, this place was perfect amongst a very cash heavy Chinatown! The spicy wontons here are delicious and second to none. The perfect blend of spicy and richness of the wontons draw me back everytime. I'm not a New Yorker, so whenever I'm in the city I try going to new places but this is the only exception I'll make. Their soup dumplings are delicious as well. I know Joe's Shanghai is more famous for their soup dumpling but I honestly cannot tell a difference!"
92,3 star rating,"Shanghai 21 specializes in dumplings &amp; they do serve some good ones. There're a few different varieties, but I do recommend their steamed watercress &amp; shrimp dumplings ($5.50 for 4). Their spicy wontons ($6.75 for 8) are also pretty good. Their xiao long bao's just mediocre though, there're def better ones to get in NY. Although, they do serve black truffle xlb and they have pretty unique taste.Their other dishes're also pretty solid + above average portion size + bigger space + fast service , so you can't really go wrong coming here. ** 3 1/2 stars overall **"
93,4 star rating,It's was my first time having soup dumpling in NYC and I wasn't disappointed. The food was amazing and the service was quick and I definitely will be returning. The one thing that I do not like is the interior of the restaurant.

95,4 star rating,"So I lived in California for 3 years and stumbled upon a great soup dumplings restaurant that I fell in love with in San Diego. After moving back to NYC I had a craving one night and found Shanghai 21.  The foodwas great, service was slow and it was just a random Thursday night, Only reason they didn't get 5 stars. Would definitely recommend though!- the black truffle dumplings were PERFECT.We also had the scallion pancakes, crispy and light. Very nice flavor as well."

99,5 star rating,"SHOCKED that I don't immediately see a plethora of reviews about the Black Truffle Soup dumplings. (??? Ya'll wyd??) Anyway, they were incredible. Completely and wholly delectable.  Usually I love adding the vinegar in the dumpling (their vinegar was excellent too btw) but I actually would say forego it for these babies. Man, they were delicious, I can't wait to go back for more. I would go back and just get 3 orders of this. We also got the hot pepper shredded beef in brown sauce, pork and shrimp lo mein, and bai Choy. Everything was excellent and came out timely.Beef- spicy and delicious. Very flavorfulBai Choy - love a crunchy veggie! Super cute tooLo mein - just a notch above your standard lo mein. Can never resist some noodles.  The wait was a bit long, but totally worth it. Around 30-40 minutes (we went on a Sunday around 2 pm). Shanghai Asian Manor, you well see me again soon. Xoxo"
100,5 star rating,"So I've been told by several people that Shanghai Asian Manor is one of the best places to get soup dumplings in NYC, and I finally got to try it out this weekend. It's in the heart of Chinatown, and we made sure to get there right when it opened around 11am. They are definitely busy, especially on weekends, so if you don't get there on the earlier side, I'd expect to wait a bit. We ordered three types of soup dumplings--pork, crab, and truffle. We also ordered the tiny fried buns, scallion pancakes, and the cha chiang mien (pork sauce noodles, which is actually a specialty of Beijing, funny enough). Everything was so, so good! Except I wouldn't order the tiny fried buns again. The hardest part is trying to decide which soup dumpling is the best. I was really impressed with the truffle soup dumplings, which I had never had before. The crab soup dumplings were also really good, because there was actually a lot of crab inside of them! Overall, I'd definitely go back here for soup dumplings for sure. The scallion pancakes and cha chiang mien would also be worth ordering again!"
