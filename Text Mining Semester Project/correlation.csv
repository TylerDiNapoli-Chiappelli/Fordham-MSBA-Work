"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",1729,cz6nfd,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/,253,"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1567554591
Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,2269,iq0w21,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iq0w21/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,116,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.**",1599763165

Capitalism makes me want to end my shit,88,m2nmyh,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2nmyh/capitalism_makes_me_want_to_end_my_shit/,23,"I'm 25 years old and I've been depressed and suicidal on and off since I was 12. At this point, since the pandemic started, killing myself is always on my mind even when i'm ""okay."" I have crippling depression and anxiety, lost my shitty amazon job recently bc i fucking hated it and could barely handle working more than a 4 hour shift without having a mental breakdown and wanting to shoot myself in the face. I have little to no motivation to do anything bc i'm always so exhausted and I sleep from 7am- 4pm every day and I feel fucking pathetic. I still live with my emotionally abusive family bc I'm mentally incapable of working a fulltime job and making enough money to move out. I hate myself so much and I feel like such a burden and i know i am. I'm a disappointment to my family and I always have been and they always make sure that i know it.

I did manage to graduate college 2 years ago with an animation degree bc doing art is the only thing im actually good at and its the only thing i can see myself doing for a job without wanting to die every second of my life. The art industry is really hard to get into, but just a few days ago I finally managed to get a job in the field i actually majored in thats actually PAID, unlike the internship I did for a year that drained the fuck out of me. This may sound like something to look forward to now, but honestly its not. I found out the job i got barely pays their employees at all, like I'll literally be doing at least 5 hours of work per week and getting $12 for it. It's basically free fucking labor AGAIN and for what??? Now I'm back to hating myself and questioning my career choice bc I'm probably not going to get very far anyway. I want to go away and move out of this house so bad, but i'm fucking stuck and I'm so scared of wtf will happen to me in the future if i even have one. I feel so powerless and useless and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Since covid started, things have just been going downhill for me (and a lot of ppl) and I've honestly never felt more disconnected from myself and my only 2 friends in my entire life. Since this whole pandemic started, the system has only shown us more and more just how much it doesn't give a fuck about anybody but rich white men. There is absolutely no winning in this disgusting capitalist world. Money is such bullshit. Like, we live in a world where we have to PROVE that we deserve basic human necessities like housing, food, and healthcare???? As if these aren't things that ppl should just have???? The US is a fucking joke, capitalism is a joke, and I honestly want no part in any of it at all. I never have and I never will. At this point i really just want to die, or live in a utopian socialist society, but obviously that's not an option.",1615489005
Being called a loser or lazy because you don't want to work or go to college,25,m2unh1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2unh1/being_called_a_loser_or_lazy_because_you_dont/,6,"Why are people who don't want to go to college or work their lives away called lazy, labelled as depressed and told that they lack motivation?

Who the fuck is genuinely motivated and excited to study or work for 40+ hours a week?

I just dropped out of college last week, so I'm officially a NEET (19 btw). I have no job or work experience don't even want a real job or career, hated high school and school in general, have a few friends but i'm socially inept, crippling social anxiety, hate myself, no talent, never had a gf, i'm not exactly ugly but i'm short.

I don't want to be a NEET or a 'bum', but I cannot see myself working a traditional job for the rest of my life or studying for 3-4 years. The only things holding me back from my fantasies are my lack of confidence due to a poor self-image, being socially inept, and the chances of actually getting anywhere.

I can't stand being forced to do shit that I don't want to do. It appears that if you have no talent or cannot monetize a creative outlet into your 'career' and become rich you HAVE TO go to college to get a bullshit 3-4 year degree as a minimum requirement, and also need like 5-years of work experience in that field. What's the point in all of this? I see a lot of people on reddit and TV ads in general saying shit like ""LeArN tO cOdE"", sorry if you actually like programming, but fuck man that shit is boring as hell. I see Instagram reels from people who are medical students or doing shit like web development for the money and I think to myself ""how do you do it?"". How are people so content with that? I need meaning in my life, not a shitty job that pays the bills. The thought of having to work or study fills me with existential dread.

I am trying to get my life back together. I'm seeing a counsellor in a week, going to try to get rid of this social anxiety by restoring a social life, work on my appearance, and try to do something like make YouTube videos or try to become a singer. I can get into hobbies like painting or drawing, writing or cooking, get my driver's license and travel and have fun. Maybe I can look for part-time bullshit jobs or do some electrician apprenticeship on the side. Fuck college, fuck getting a degree, fuck working.

I think I may be depressed, and I think I've had depression for like 3-years, but maybe with professional help and self-improvement it'll subside. It's funny how my mental health gets better when I have no responsibilities. I always feel good when I'm not in a hellish environment like school. Maybe i'm not depressed and it's just porn addiction and escapism through masturbating excessively. Perhaps that's why my brain is fried. I'm on 'NoFap' at the moment (maybe it's bullshit idc), i've been doing NoFap on and off for a few years and i've actually maintained some long streaks. I'm currently on like a month streak and feel better. You just feel a lot more energised and ready to tackle your problems head-on. I recommend doing it even if you think it's bullshit.

I'm sick of this narrative that you're a useless bum if you don't work or study. Everyone is expected to fit into this box, and if you don't then you're defective? I'm awful at school no matter how hard I try, and it doesn't interest me at all, it feels like mental and physical torture.

Your life isn't your job or what you study, it's what you do outside of it. Being social and having hobbies is what really matters. Hopefully, I'll be one of those success stories who made it big, or maybe i'll hang from the ceiling.

I just don't see the point in working a shitty job and hating my life for 40 years. I'm fed up of having to lie to myself and blind myself with optimism. My parents are workaholics and only get an hour to rest after work, they have no lives, no friends, don't go out, and don't have any hobbies. Do I really want that life?

Don't even try to convince me that's an acceptable life...",1615510082

The thought of being a 50 year old kissless virgin terrifies me. It's gotten to the point where it doesn't let me enjoy anything. And browsing subreddits like ForeverAlone hasn't helped. It's not even about the physical thing honestly. I think I'm on the asexual spectrum so I don't really crave it. And after being hurt on the last relationship, even if it was long distance, I really don't know if I want another relationship. Plus, currently with my depression and anxiety, I have pretty much a non existent libido. It's 99% the stigma and the label.

I've gotten obsessed for months with the idea of seeing an escort. To desmistify sex and stop obsessing over it. To get rid of the label, and maybe find some inner peace. But I really don't know what would happen. It could greatly help me, or make me even more depressed.",1615506294

However, I do feel like these very sentiments have been used as leverage for my employer to stack on more and more work/responsibility and I am losing my ability to keeping doing this day in and day out. I have a collection of different issues including ADHD, PTSD and an eating disorder. Mainly, I think the ADHD is adding to my inability to perform. I just don’t have the mental fortitude to keep at it this way. I’m depressed, I’m anxious, I have no interest in literally anything. I feel like a zombie. It’s beginning to morph into a performance issue and I really cannot afford to lose my job. I have a mortgage, a car payment and a family that depends on me. 

I know that no amount of money is worth feeling suicidal and hating your life, but I also know I will not be able to find a similar job or even a different job with similar pay the way the job market is right now. I can’t afford to quit and I also can’t go on like this. Everyday I am terrified and anxious of losing my job or that I’ll spontaneously combust if I keep on this way. 

I guess I’m wondering - should I take FMLA/short term disability to get some therapy while I figure it out? Should I try to find another job? Should I just throw in the towel and run away to Mexico? I can’t do this anymore and the thought of doing this everyday for another 30 years just to pay bills and die seems like a very sad existence. I really need a little bit of support and guidance and probably a vacation. 

Any advice appreciated. Especially from someone in a similar situation or who has taken FMLA and how that process worked.",1615441011

I'd rather kill myself which sounds terrible because it sounds like less of a burden. 

My job just has be down. One of my favorite residents told me she was ready to die last week and now shes in the hospital. Another resident told me she doesnt want to live if she has to live like that. I walked in on somsone trying to kill themselves a few weeks ago. 

I feel guilty I get to go home every night and see my family and even guilty when I'm the suicidal one and feel like they have more of a reason than I do.

I can’t find someone to share my life with.
I can’t see a decent future for myself. 
I can’t move on.
I can’t forget the past. 

I want more than anything to be a normal person who doesn’t second guess every action I take. I criticize myself so much more than I criticize others. Why am I so hard on myself? It’s to the point where I can’t stand to look at myself in the mirror. All I see are my flaws. All I see are my stupid decisions and past trauma staring back at me like: “you are this way because of your own decisions”
I want to wake up in the morning and not have this dreaded feeling of another empty day filled with loneliness and my brain constantly putting me down. I want to be able to sleep without having dreams that wake me up in the middle of the night. Dreams that crush me because they are snippets of the reality that I face every day. 
I want someone there who cares. In person. Who can see my flaws and accept me. I want to share a life with someone. Watch movies, and play games, and have kids, and buy a house. But I can’t help but feel like that’s never going to happen for me. 
If I can’t love myself how is anyone else going to ever love me? 
I want to live my life without constantly feeling like I’m some sort of fake. A phony. I want to feel like I deserve my job and my friends and my family. 
It’s like there is this pressure in the back of my mind urging me to give up. What’s the point? Who even cares? What are you even working towards? Do you actually think you’ll ever be normal? Why don’t you just kill Yourself? Would dying really be that bad? Who would even notice? How long would it take for someone to notice you’re gone? Weeks? Months?

I don’t get it. I don’t understand why people who won’t care about their kids have them. I wish I could go back in time and make it so my parents never met. I have my “whole life ahead of me” but if my life so far has been depression, self harm, substance abuse, major family issues I don’t want to go into detail because it’s so hurtful and personal etc does that even count as a life? Or a waste of space and someone who shouldn’t have been born? They say it will get better and I want to laugh in your face. It doesn’t. And it won’t. I have been trying and trying for so long but nothing I ever do is good enough I feel like I was just born to fail. I barely eat or drink water I’m shocked I’m not sick and I’m still alive. I don’t do anything throughout the day because nothing makes me happy or feel anything. I’m just a WASTE OF LIFE. I don’t even know what I want to do after highschool because nothing interests me or makes me feel anything in the slightest. I have been bullied, jumped, almost got stabbed last year&they even posted my selfies online and made fun of me so everyone could see, attempted suicide, self harmed since before I was 12, been to 8 different schools throughout my life due to bullying and my mental health issues and just moving around constantly. and now I’m so depressed to the point I can’t feel or do anything. Everything that has been done to me by people makes me want to hurt them back but instead I hurt myself and I want to die. I’ve stared death right in the face and he doesn’t scare me anymore. I tried therapy. I tried meds. None of it has ever worked. The meds that did work they took away because they were “too addictive”. No matter where I go people don’t like me and make fun of me even though I don’t do anything to them. I might as well have a target on my back 24/7. Sometimes I just wish they could put me to sleep forever just so I won’t have to struggle like this anymore. They always say that other people have it worse and that just makes me feel even more guilty for the people who have it worse off than me. I want to do something in this world to help people but if I can’t get out of this how can I?

If he's not working, he's watching youtube or playing a game. He hardly talks to me at all. If I ask for help, he makes such a big deal about how I should be able to handle things myself and that I don't help him at his job, so why should he help with mine. I've just stopped asking for help. He told me that my thoughts and feelings were stupid, so I can't talk to him about that either.

I can't even pick on mother's day or my birthday.

The kids: My husband wanted kids. Because I grew up with abusive parents, I really didn't want children. So we have two kids. Both have special needs and I've been the sole caregiver for their whole lives. Dad wants nothing to do with them. So I'm stuck doing everything that involves them.

I've had days where I've been screamed at and cursed out by the kids and then I'm stuck doing their schoolwork and making sure it gets turned in. They've grown up watching their dad do nothing and ignore me, so they do the same thing.

My job: I have owned and run my own artsy business for 18 years. At first my husband was helpful and supportive. Since I lost 75% of my income in 2020 due to cancelled events, he's been telling me that my art is a waste of time and that no one wants it anymore. I also had 2 other part time jobs since we've been married because he thought I wasn't pulling my weight enough in the household. One job I quit after 7 years because of an abusive boss and my husband asked me to quit the other one because he wanted me to be at home more. 

The breaking point: He told me in early 2021 that I was too fat and he wouldn't love me unless I lost weight, back to my weight when we first met. I'll admit that I've put on some weight, but I've had 2 kids and a ton of stress in the past 18 years. He's gained 60 pounds since we met and I haven't said a peep. So I went on a diet. I stopped eating desserts and bread. I've lost almost 15 pounds in 6 weeks. Not a word from the husband. I'm going to keep going. He knows that I had anorexia in high school. I'll just keep going until I'm a skeleton. 

He doesn't believe in divorce, so my only way out is to die. I'll stop eating completely on May 1st.",1615505711

Convincing myself every day to not end my life is really really hard,5,m2u3ok,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2u3ok/convincing_myself_every_day_to_not_end_my_life_is/,1,"I don't know what to say particularly and I don't know why I'm writing here, but yeah. Every day is just me trying to convince myself to not end my life. I aready have a clear idea of how I'm gonna do it, but I guess I'm also scared. My family's religous so all my life, I've been taught that ending my own life would...you know, not do me any good in the afterlife. I guess that's the only thing stopping me at this point. I don't know what else to do to stop myself. Talking to my friends or doing things I'm interested in just won't work. No coping mechanism or words of motivation just works. My life is just so messed up. Juggling college, an unstable mental state, and responsibilities at home is just too much for me. I'm not learning anymore since I don't have the time and the means to study without distractions or catch up with lessons I did not fully understand. I have to do so much responsibilities at home and I really envy those who haveall the time they need to study. On top of that, I don't agree with my entire family in terms of religious beliefs anymore, but I can't just tell them. Life would be harder if I do. For a particular reason, I also can't be with the person I like. I can't even confess about my feelings. Because of all these, I feel like I have to pretend all my life. I have to suppress my feelings and I have to pretend that I believe in the same things that my family believes in. While going through college. While having good grades, or else I'll lose my scholarship. While keeping up with my responsibilities at home. While staying sane. What's the point of living, then? I can never be truly happy. It's either I kill myself or tell these people about all my concerns. But I don't have the courage too. Because believe me, it would never end well because I know them. I also can't take a gap year or something. I don't have the courage to deviate from what's ""normal."" That's all I have to say. Just wish me luck and hope that I stay alive, I guess.

Extremely Suicidal because Emotional Support Animal has Cancer and is deteriorating,2,m2zgj8,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2zgj8/extremely_suicidal_because_emotional_support/,2,"Hello, I suffer foremost from major depression among other mental illnesses.  I adopted an feline a little over 2 and half years ago and he quickly became my emotional support animal.  He was 10 years old when I adopted him.  I never had an animal in my life.  He was very healthy until the last few months when he was diagnosed with cancer.  He is the light and love of my life and I am not ready to say goodbye.  He saved my life from suicide.  My grief tells me to end my life immediately.  My depression tells me to quit my job and move on the streets.  He is my inspiration, my joy; my baby; my angel; my best friend; my soulmate; my love; my hero.  Why me? Why now? Why my emotional support animal?  I have been writing suicide letters.  I graduated from law school and I was supposed to be a lawyer but now I know I can never retake the bar exam without him.  I will never practice law without him.  I am spiraling towards a suicide attempt and know that I will really hurt my family but I feel trapped.  Because of my mental illness I never had anything to love.  I never had a girlfriend or many friends.  This was my first chance to express my affection for something at 36 years of age.  I never experienced unconditional love my entire life.  I know that most people will claim that I can just get another feline since another animal can offer me unconditional love and emotional support.  But I cannot bear to say the same things I said to him to another animal.  I could never tell another animal ""I love you"" or ""you are the love of my life""; ""you are one in a million"". A feline needs love and I only had one love of my life.  I spend time researching suicide and I fantasize about quitting my job and becoming homeless.  On the streets I won't last long and it will be the functional equivalent of a more impulsive suicide act.  I am lost and I don't know what will happen to me next.",1615522023

I don’t want to “feel better”. I don’t want to “improve my quality of life”. Nobody gets it. I just don’t want existence. Period.,3,m2w01m,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2w01m/i_dont_want_to_feel_better_i_dont_want_to_improve/,0,"I’ve been through the bad times. I don’t want them. I’ve been through the good times. I don’t want them. I’ve been through the neutral times. I. Don’t. Want. Them.

”Well what about your family and friends? Don’t you love them? Live for them!”

Why, though? Just because I am acquainted with certain other personalities aside from my own doesn’t make them any less “of this existence”. Everything I am, everything they are is simply an amalgamation of memories from birth. Why should I stay alive just to help them avoid loss of serotonin for a little while? 

I was brought to this world without my consent. Some religious people may say otherwise, but I have no such memory of deciding to come here. Any decision “I” may have made to come here is not a part of my conscious being, therefore I (the person writing this right now) am not the same person that decided to come here. Any way you look at it, it was not my choice to be born.

“Live for yourself! Make a good life for yourself! Improve your quality of life?”

Again, why? Positive and negative experiences are simply things. One is not inherently better than the other. It’s just a different state of brain chemistry. We may have been programmed from birth to prefer one state over the other, but that is the key phrase: from birth.  Why am I supposed to care about having more moments of what the world has taught my are “good brain chemistry”.  And why am I supposed to care about continually “learning” from the “bad brain chemistry”.

“Don’t worry! It will get better! It always gets better!”

First off, no, not always. Second, this state of “better” is just another freakin state of brain chemistry. It’s stupid that I even have to go through this with people. 

The whole idea is completely nonsensical. So, I’m just supposed to keep living just because, right? Because one day two people boinked and out I popped I’m just supposed to keep playing pretend with everyone.

You do realize we’re a bunch of monkeys living on a big rock, right? Yet, we have areas of land with borders and tell ourselves that one area is different then all the others. We have governments, groups of monkeys with pretend authority to do any number of things. There are countless examples because society itself is one big fucking game of playing pretend. Excuse me for wanting to opt out.

But no, you can’t stop playing because other monkeys don’t like it. Give me a break.

I’m tired of pretending that I’m anything more than a talking monkey on a giant rock, and I’m tired of nonsensically caring about the difference between so called “good states of brain chemistry” and “bad states of brain chemistry”. All in all, I am tired of playing pretend.",1615513331

Today, I got my eyes tested again. Everything wad normal, exept that my pressures were **extremely** high (around 28-30?) Because of this they gave me new drops, which brought it down to 17-20. 

And guess what? They also found out my optic nerve is 'cupping', which is basically when the pressure pusles on the nerve, which is obviously not good. So, we have to travel to get things checked out.

I already have a plan thought up in my head, and I'm try to put it into action in my last 1 and half years of life. There's so many things wrong with me that I wouldn't be able to fit them all here. I don't have anyone to talk to, not even my own family likes talking with me. I really want friends, but people don't like me, and honestly they have no reason to like me. I don't even try to make friends anymore. For the past year I've been so bored, tired, or uninterested of everything that I spend most of my day in bed doing absolutely nothing. I can't imagine being an adult. I would never know what it was like having friends or someone to talk during childhood. I don't want to live that life.

No I’m not professionally diagnosed because health professionals here are jackshit and no one takes you seriously until you off yourself. I’ve done counselling x3 and therapy x1 and it didn’t help at all.

I’m just so tired of life, I genuinely can’t do this anymore and the only reason I’m writing here is because I don’t know what else to do, I have no other outlet. “It gets better or people have it worse”, is all I ever get told, but I don’t blame people around me because how can they help if I can’t even help myself. I’m literally such a fucking disappointment and embarrassment to my friends and family and most of all- myself. 

I’m failing once again at staying in education, I mentally can’t deal with it, I don’t know what I want to do in life because I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I’ve lost motivation for everything. I hate my body and everything about myself overall, I must be so fucking annoying to other people and I realise it. I struggle with my femininity on a daily basis and my sexuality too. I think I’m asexual/biromantic but I don’t know anymore. I’ll never find someone because of this and all my attempts at relationships have been failures due to this.

I truly love my family but they don’t seem to fully understand what I’m going through. And certain family problems are also the root of my problems. I love all my family and friends but I want to be selfish for once and finally end it. I can’t keep living for others, it hurts so much and I’m so fucking tired. I lash out on other people either way or I zone out because it feels like I’m disassociating sometimes.

I'm a failure.,4,m2q1rg,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2q1rg/im_a_failure/,1,"I've had 3 jobs and not managed to keep or be at one. I've had countless relationships where I give so much and I treat them like ibwant to marry them and yet within a week to 7 months they all abandon me.

I can't do anything right. And even though my family all see that I'm struggling no one has offered me assistance or support. They all know I'm struggling but nobody has said or done anything.

And it's becoming more and more of a fantasy to shoot myself in the brain stem in the woods somewhere. I mean what's even the point? Grow up have a successful job retire and have kids just so they can all do the exact same thing over again?

What is that? That's not living. That's not hopeful. That's nothing. And all of that is even more useless and nothing  when you don't have a partner. I'm not hideous. I'm attractive. I try my hardest so hard to make my partners happy. And the most recent two, one of them said she couldn't deal with me because I was too nice and understanding and affectionate and she didn't know how to do that, and the second one I waited for her for months and then she meets someone new whilst I was waiting for her? What the fuxk is that? It's like all women do is take advantage of me, use me until they find something better and then abandon me. It seems more and more like I'm just here to show other people how good things can be and I get nothing in return. I know it's selfish to want something more than to just be hope for others but I do. And I don't see anything especially not when all I've had is failure is discontent since 2016.

I just want to be free. I don't want to live here anymore. I don't want to make a difference, I don't want to have children, I don't want to exist I just want it all to end. And the more I think about it the more surreal all of this seems. There's so much stupid shit that goes on that everyone just accepts as normal that utterly doesn't make sense to me. And I don't know when but one of these times I'm going to do it. Most of the time I'm so numb I don't even want to die I just... continue to exist out of habit I guess. But it's a pattern where everytime something or someone comes along that I really begin to enjoy it gets dashed upon the ground violently over and over again until all that is left is nothing but despair. And when that happens I can feel myself struggling until it feels like my brain is being pulled apart and there's this high pitched ringing and I just have to do it. I have to kill myself. 

I slept last night because all the stores that sell guns were closed but I think I may have to preemptively go out and buy one soon when I can feel the rising tides of horror within. That's the day I will blow my brains out in the woods. I've had enough of this life. I've had enough of being taken advantage of. I've had enough of being lied to. I just want it all to end. 

And honestly I don't want any of your support. I just csnt say any of this to anyone because no one will listen or think that I am serious. But I am. So this is just sort of a prequel to a final message I guess. I don't want your support so don't even bother. It just feels good to justify my actions and put reasons into words.",1615498078

Why is it so hard to just peacefully die. I really believe it should be possible to just die a painless death. We have the technology.

I get why suicide prevention exists. I think it's super important for victims of trauma. People who can be happy, can recover, and be a real member of society. I believe those people deserve the resources to get better because they have the ability to recover.

But why does it have to be so hard for me to die. Just let me pass peacefully. Maybe donate my organs so I'm not a pure waste of resources. Suicide prevention is actively harmful for me. Preventing me from dying will not solve my problems.",1615467177

I jsut dont deserve any of my firends becasue i ahve failed them at one point and rn i am just oen massive negative blob with so many issues i am trying to sift through and i keep spiralling about being a horrible person because i have been in the past but i dont like hurting people or being the cause of upsetting anyone 

I ve been going in and out of overwhelming anxiety aout the past for not being a good frined at the time or being basically a bitch and no trelasing it until too late. I was really upset and felt like i didnt deserve two of my closet frineds because htey where bullied at work by our friend and i had no idea it was happing to them and didnt stand up agianst the bully for them when i found some bits out- the bully was a very good at manipulation and i thought was a good friend to the three of us.

But i still was wrong, it bitched about my new friend to the girl that became the bully, she was teh team leader and i was frustrated because my firmed would disappear and just bit annoying and it was very busy season in retail- i thought she could help me find the girl and just talk to her and helo fix or actually train her becasue there was till mistakes but due to lack of training and staff to take over. but i ended up being  a gossip, the team leader would ask how is so on so and i would say oh the same old jsut disappearing or being inappropriate and have a little rant. My freind used always say some relly funny comments and jokes adn just had a dirty mouth and i d tell the girl because we where all friends and she had asked to keep her in the loop because she didn't get to hang out with us often- so if anything fun happened id go to her and tell her and the other girl working in the kitchen- i didn thave any mena or curel intetnions just listen to this it was really funny. but it started to get cruel and at the expense to the girl and i realsied this and said it had to stop and i stopped going to that girl to vent or relay on silly jokes because it isnt funny when they arent their and they where getting a bit mean. i felt disgusted that i would ever do that becasue i am against all things drama and gossipy, i just got into haveing a laugh and just i was really stressed out with the girl- i never ever siad anything horirble and i stopped talking about her to that girl after because i realsied she was jsut encouraging me to get gossip and i felt so two faced. Bascially the team leader turned out to be a manupualtive bully and did some hroribel things i had no idea was happening. 

I feel like idont deserve my two friends because i didnt see what was happening that they couldnt tell me what was happing and i couldnt and didnt stop it. i should have reproted the first incindent, i though becasue i told them to stop it was over ebcause there was no horribleness for a long time but its ebcause it was never doen in front of me and always in private.  I  still feel like a shit friend because some of the jokes at the expense of my firend i laughed at and help create but i thought we where just having a laugh at the ridiculous things our friend had said and where sharing sotries of mroe ridclous dirty jokes- but the other two where beginning to be cruel with it and i shut it down and stopped talking to them for sometime becaus ei felt so disgusted that i ever bitched about my firend and let these jokes happen. i told them to stop because it was too far- they werent horrible just they weren't funny and turns out they had a lot of jokes they had made and only said to certain people to be horrible to them- but i worry i helped in them starting these jokes because i shared the silly stories of our freind-  had no horrible intentions i thought it was just some banter but its never funny if the person isnt there. 

I didtn talk to them for sometime becasue i was becomeing a gossip around them and didnt want to be like that. it all calmed down for ages until some bullying started and i didnt speak up about what was said months earlier but it was just a joke dragged out and laughing at the perosn and i stopped it. I gave the girl the benfit of a doubt becasue we where all freinds but i stil bithced about my close friend even if i thoguth it was jsut venting or shairing funny stories it wasnt nice and a joke was taken to far calling her a name. i till laighed at first but it was taken too far and i stopped it. i should have came forward about it when evidence was needed against the girl being a bully but at the time i couldnt fully remeber exactly what was said and becasue i was in part to balme for that.

i still feel so guilty for ever being in that situation to laugh and joke about a friend and not realsing they where doing it to be mean and for not having reported that sooner- the bullying all came public 6 months later after i was a being bitchy. 

I was really upset becase ui feel so guilty becase i dont want to hurt peopel or being horribel and i hate msyelf for being so naive and not realsing how horrible they where being and for not actually stopping other bullying - i didnt know it was going on but i worry that me joking at first with them fueld them to start picking on her becasue thats what we where doing realistically even if i dint intend to it was that. i did stop it and kept them at arms reach and nothing was goin gon for ages until 6 months later and i felt so guilty for it for not stopping it and by bitching to them in the first place.

I told my friend this after 4 years, i was panicking at how horrible i was too her and not releasing thats what iwas doing and for fiaing to be a good frined to both by not knowing what was going on. I lvoe them both so much  and we have been through a lot all together. My freind is upset to think i did vent to them and laugh about her but she doesn't want to think about the past. I wish i never brought it up because it wasn't fair, i had deleted the messages but she had seen the one with me admitting to venting and taking the mick. I dont know where to go from here i wish i never did it in the first place and telling her after so long. I am being toxic and slefish for bringing up the past i just was in a bad mental place and so uspet and panicked over being a shit freind and not stopping the person that was hurting them

I ve always regretted it and felt so horrible because my firend is so kind and has been there for me through thick and thin and i was a horrible friend by bitching and not telling her sooner. i just dont know if i do deserve them because i did do a bad thing even if i had nt intended it and i failed at realising what a horrible person the bully was sooner when i had seen her be super bitchy and gossipy- i just never thought she could do what she had done. I feel so worthless and such a horrible person for not being a better friend and for being toxic and bring up the past because i am being a little pathetic- i just dont think i am good enough for the both of them and this guilt of being bitchy has sat with me for ages 

i want to still be their friend i jsut had this overwhelming feeling they should no because i want to be honest and not false and because i feel like she would be better off without me. rn now i am in some bad mental health and she is struggling too and my selfish ness is only going to make her feel back stabbed and i wish i never said anything, i wish i was never horrible to begin with",1615522753

There’s always somebody worse off and it’s even worse when I look at my life and realise that. I feel this shit and it’s only going to get worse as I get older. I don’t pay bills or have any real responsibilities yet. 

It started when I was at school I got bullied like mad, I’m 27 now and it has impacted my whole life. I’m a kind person and that’s what they targeted, I try to stay away from people now. I’m also a virgin, doesn’t bother me as much anymore I’ve just accepted it. I have dated and kissed and all that other stuff. I have no confidence and my self esteem is shot. I’m not even ugly, I’m 6”2 and I’m in good shape. It’s not like I should have confidence problems looking at me but I do. 

I was really ill last year and it was right when Covid hit last March. I was so happy when I got better yet Covid has just dragged on and on. Half of my left foot is still numb and nerve damaged and my lymph nodes are not right. Then mentally I just haven’t recovered as I can’t get going again properly since Covid. I’m so unfit and just like a hermit. My family has a rare genetic disorder with our lungs so we have done nothing for a year apart from work from August-January. I got demoted and my wages slashed by £2.50 an hour to minimum wage, lied to over and over again. I worked with my dad and they sacked him for shielding due to Covid. He got me tools for Christmas as he was going to train me up to be an engineer. Now that’s gone and I will never use them I’m so upset about it and angry. I will never get to work with him again and I have to go back to the place that sacked him. 

I’ve been having problems with my testicles, kidney and urinating. I went for a ct scan and ultrasound that showed nothing. I cancelled the cystoscopy as I didn’t want a camera sticking up my penis and I felt better. But now my problems have returned so I’m panicking and thinking it’s something serious. 

Today I just admitted to my dad I want to give up. That I wouldn’t be bothered if I just died. I find enjoyment in absolutely nothing and it’s getting worse. On a weekly basis since last March it’s one thing after the other pushing me down. I just don’t want to live like this. What the hell is the point. Even after Covid I won’t even do anything. I have no friends all I do is stay in the house. I keep wanting Covid to end yet I’m going to be stuck inside like a prison anyway.

I am going to kill myself if the doctors don't help me figure out what's wrong with my body,2,m2tnx6,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2tnx6/i_am_going_to_kill_myself_if_the_doctors_dont/,2,"In my experience, most doctors are NOT reliable. I had severe endometriosis for twelve years and saw four different gynecologists who all refused to diagnose or treat it before I finally found someone who actually knew what he was doing and gave me surgery. By that time, I had been bleeding and in constant pain for about a year. During surgery, he found that the endometriosis had spread all throughout my abdominal cavity, to my ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, abdominal wall, vagina, rectovaginal septum, colon, and bladder. It would not have spread that far or caused me so much suffering if they had just fucking TREATED me to begin with!

Something runs in my family on my mom's side that doctors haven't figured out yet. I'm sick of being gaslit and seeing my family members gaslit by doctors who can't just fucking admit that they don't know what's going on. My mom's decline became noticeable and severe when she was in her early 40s. Now, at 50, she walks with a cane and can only stand for a few hours at a time. My uncle seems to have the same problem and they've both been getting seen by doctors for this entire time and their results are weird but nothing seems to fix it or explain it completely. I'm terrified that I'm going to end up like them. I can't live like that. My mom can't live on her own and has to be taken care of by my stepdad, and it's hard enough for her. I cannot trust any other human to take care of me in that way because experiences have shown me that humans cannot be trusted to have that kind of power over me. I would rather die than give someone else that chance. I also *need* to be able to do physical activity in order to be happy. I can't live without it. If I do survive to old age, I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it.

I'm 26 and I've already had arthritis since I was 24. I don't seem to have any connective tissue diseases, which is good. In addition to endometriois (which thankfully has been a non-issue since my most recent surgery, especially since I'm taking testosterone), I've been diagnosed with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, IBS (which is basically a cop-out diagnosis from what I understand), interstitial cystitis (which they found in my bladder during the first endometriosis surgery), and PTSD. I have some other symptoms that might not be explained by these things, and all I want is to know what the FUCK is going on with my body so that I can know what to expect from my body and plan my life. If it's something that I can prevent behaviorally (like by cutting out another food group or getting a sun lamp or something), I want to know so I can prevent it. If it's something I just have to live with, then I want to know so I can plan my career around having an average of 1-3 days a month where I can't work. If I'm going to end up like my mom, that means I have about fifteen years to live and that will make a big difference in what I try to do with my life. I just want to know so I can decide whether to pursue grad school, whether to try to have kids, etc.

I desperately hope for every doctor who's ever dismissed or ignored or gaslit or failed a patient in any way to experience every ounce of the suffering they've caused, tenfold. They do not deserve to make money off of our suffering. If they don't know what's wrong, they should just fucking admit it. I've been getting so frustrated with trying to get help and I'm getting concerned by my fantasies. Ordinarily, I would never wish harm on another person, but I've thought about going to a doctor's office and killing myself in a violent, graphic way to try to give them lasting trauma and make them understand that it's *their* fault so many people suffer unnecessarily for so long. I don't usually hate entire groups of people but I'm growing to hate doctors. My grandmother on my mom's side hates doctors so much that she refuses almost all medical treatment, even pain pills, and I am starting to understand why. What's happening to my family is real, and we need help, but very few doctors have actually done their best to help us. I'm scared and desperate and so *fucking* frustrated.",1615507601

How is suicide not the answer?,9,m2ler8,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2ler8/how_is_suicide_not_the_answer/,5," You have to combine 3 different points to get to this answer, but it has a solid truth to it.

I've lived a privileged life with a loving family. I am also a history lover and a policy geek. The best policies are the preventative ones, not the reactionary ones. This is true in everything from habits, to dealing with any problem. If you set something up before the problem arises, you did the smart thing. So by killing myself, I would be avoiding all issues that could arise. While, it may be removing all possible feelings of joy too, isn't the point of life to struggle for a bit of joy and savor it? The cost to benefit ratio is so out of whack, that it's not a worthy investment.

I also know the human brain usually hates doing the right thing. People will put off the most mundane action item that takes minutes and cause themselves weeks of suffering. Tasks are usually more difficult if the less often that you've completed the task. So by this logic, killing yourself, which makes most people cry before attempting, is going to be tough. But once you get through it, then you will be relieved.

Lastly, the world is getting more and more powerful with technology. Before things changed slowly and the rich and powerful didn't have all the information. But now with Big Data and the power of social media propaganda, they have so much more power. Fighting against it is so tough. Education the masses is almost impossible with social media and video games and addiction to things like JUULs being so easy. The world is changing and changing so fast, that eventually I'll just be an old man that's out of touch and dying to new diseases that are mutating faster and faster due to overuse of antibiotics and pesticides. Even if I did choose to get old, I'd either end up alone or have kids and neither are options. Being alone is fine but it's not a long term solution and having kids means that I'm forcing this terrible existence onto some poor soul.

I'm just sorry for my parents who have spent so much on me and are boring now. They tell me I'm the light of their life on multiple occasions and I don't doubt it because there's nothing there for them. Just the aches of being old and the strain of staying alive. To have to suffer my death will be tough for them, but that's not really a problem for me once I'm dead.",1615479602

My dad is living in an other place cause he was suicidal. I had to care for him since my mom passed, I heard him all the time saying that he wanted to kill himself. I had to sell all the stuff from my house, cause I couldn't afford the rent anymore, all the memories from my childhood, almost all the things I grew up with are gone know.

Everyday my thoughts are filled with imagining different ways of ending my life, what would happen if i failed, which ways would succeed and which ways wouldnt. its taking up a large majority of my day i can no longer focus on my school work or home responsibilities. i feel TERRIBLE for just dumping depressing shit on my friends. like imagine some sack of shit just bring your day down. im ignoring them for now as my suicidal ideations grow more intense because i cannot go a day without speaking about how much i wanna end my life. and in my mind, its wrong to force them in a position of worry like that. i think im ready to take my life. ive written up a fake suicide note as a vent (not to actually leave behind) in hopes that doing so will relieve these ideations. but it doesnt work when waking up and living is a constant reminder of how i have to deal with emotional burden of my trauma, disorders etc. i dont wanna learn how to deal with living with these things because it doesnt seem worth to do so anymore. I dont know who to talk to, because honestly i think being hospitalized or held is the only way of saving me. i just dont know how to get there before its too late with actually going through with my planned suicide methods. my biggest fear is attempting to end my life, and ending up with damaging my body etc. thats a large reason why im hesitant to attempt suicide, the risk of failure. i dont have access to any guns and stuff so ive extensively researched methods. I cant reach out to friends because theyre not trained professionals. i dont see my psychiatrist for awhile. i dont know who to reach for help. i might just call the hotline in the midsts of my attempt and get hospitalized then.",1615518858
"Time zooming by, and suicide feels like the only way to take control.",3,m2pqic,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2pqic/time_zooming_by_and_suicide_feels_like_the_only/,0,"Tl;dr: Time is go zoom zoom and I've done nothing substantial. Suicide feels like the only way to give me control of SOMETHING. 

March arrived faster than I was anticipating. It's almost heartbreaking how fast it came, considering how little I've achieved. A slice of this year gone and I've not done much of what I set out to do. Everyday I wake up sluggish because of insomnia, meaning I'll waste precious minutes in bed. Trying to gain what little rest I was denied during the night. 

Then I wake up, exercise as hard as I can, eat, and read. By the time I'm doing this it's near 12 to 1 and the hours fall into each other after that. I find myself unable to not look at a clock, unable to not think of the precious minutes passing. 

I tell myself I could be writing but I've done not enough reading to justify that. Not enough sources of inspiration to pull from. 

I know this may sound silly to a lot of people. Others have more legitimate reasons for taking their own lives. I'm not exactly depressed as I once was, or at all, you could say. I've laughed more, smiled more, pushed myself more (given how much self-quarantining would allow) than I did even a year ago. But it doesn't feel like it's enough. 

I fear leaving my youth behind making nothing of myself. Or never trying my hardest to do so. Suicide seems better than being here having achieved nothing. And I'm not in a position where ""You don't need to have achieved this by your twenty something's"" sounds reasonable. I should be beyond where I am now..

Should have been years ago.",1615497037

They never really have. I don’t believe that I am paranoid but I have been told the contrary. These things make sense to me. I’m not sure why they don’t make sense to you. I’ve been having panic attacks since I was a toddler. I’m tired. I’m done.

I feel isolated. I don’t feel any connection with my partner whatsoever. No one checks in on me. My grandmother is the only person that I’ve ever felt truly loved by and she’s been gone for a few years. 

This isn’t because of COVID. This isn’t because I’m on unemployment and can’t find work. Sure, those things have had a hand in influencing this... but no. This has been a moment in the making for two decades. I’m almost grateful that I’ve gotten my final push.

Things do get better, actually. Don’t let anyone fool you. Yet the funny thing that I’ve learned is that it never sticks. Now everything is much worse than it was before it even got better. It all just repeats. I’m sure that’s the cycle of life, right? We can’t feel the same emotions forever. It’s literally impossible. But I’m not convinced most people have a mind as loud as mine. It needs to be silenced. 

I hope there is no hell or other-religion equivalent. Perhaps I’m already there. Maybe this all plays like the same loop that my life’s been. Who’s to say anyone other than me even has consciousness? I’d love to put more thought into this... but I can’t.

I almost didn't make it.,1,m2xrup,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2xrup/i_almost_didnt_make_it/,0,"I wanted to leave you this message before I get back to work.

I was severely suicidal--assisted by money (-$200K), relationships (so many...), living situation (fighting neighbors, paper thin walls), a little guilt (...). I was probably a foot away from the rushing water of Styx, kneeling before it, seeing the fog of the other side. But with the help of some supporting people and words of people who have no idea who I am, when it hurt, I visualized myself taking another step. When the foggy blackness surrounded me, and all I knew was severe emotional pain, the vision of my foot stepping forward came to mind. A vision followed where my past weak self shed off me as I took these steps. I saw a silhoutte colored with the sun, taking step after step, shedding the past weakness, keeping only what was strong. 

These visions of letting go of what can't handle it, and keeping only what's strong enough for this world has brought me strength. Since doing this, things that sent me into a downward spiral have started to bounce off my shoulder. Money? I can look at it and make plans. That painful memory? The other painful memory? ... *Another* painful memory? I've started to dissect what's wrong with it, and how I could improve my character. I've started to think about what I would say if I could see these people again. Or how I'll treat the next people better. I've looked up houses that I could move to. Since having these visions, I feel a sense of strength deep in my gut. Seeing myself taking the steps, seeing myself throwing off the weak parts, has given me a kind of endurance I didn't know someone like me could have.

One day, I just sat in my chair, looked at my apartment, and felt. I experienced. I was. When you get so close to the river Styx like that, and then you come back to the world, I think anyone would see it differently. It's like, ""I'm still alive."" I understand what [Steven Hawking meant when he said](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/the-science-of-secondguessing.html), ""My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus”. Experiencing life after those feelings is as if you have a second life, and everything here is a bonus. 

Sometimes all it takes is a word, or small act to change the course of everything. I'm a random voice in the dark, but we've both felt pain. We both were close death.  I hope this reaches to you and gives you a few more breaths, a chance to take another step, and some time to build yourself up and maybe fix some of what is wrong with the world. I said this in [an earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lxhxey/i_dont_have_a_voice_for_it_but/), ""I believe it's people like you who suffer most who know how to make the world worth staying.""

Is this all life is-,1,m2xqr5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2xqr5/is_this_all_life_is/,0,"I'm a very creative person.

I'm an artist, storyteller, baby streamer, writer on occasion. I ***love*** what I do - and I'm very, *very* lucky to have a tiny, tiny following & community that support me. I want to preface this whole thing by saying I am eternally grateful for that support in my work, and I'm not trying to spit on it. This account / handle is very separate & anonymous from all that, I just have to get my thoughts out.

When COVID hit, I lost my job at a wedding venue. I didn't *like* the job, far from it, but it was decent enough thanks to chill management & co-workers. Not viable at all as a ""career"", but something.

But anyways, COVID hit, venue shut down, had to move back in with - a frankly, abusive - family. All I want is to get out here, get back to living alone, have some semblance of peace.

I managed to snag a temporary, work-from-home seasonal position over Christmas. It was hell. Living hell. 12-hour a day shifts, seven days a week, miserable work - honestly, it was customer service, need I say more? All the while my family applaud me for 'doing what I *should* do with my life' instead of wasting it on creative things. By them I am now ""finally not entirely worthless"" or ""finally growing up"" or I ""finally topped being lazy and a failure"".

I am a guy that pretty much never cries or shows much emotion at all - but I'll be damned if every time I woke up, I wished I could cry just to vent the misery and overwhelming unhappiness the job caused me. Ended up quitting as soon as they told us seasonal employees would start getting let go. Didn't stick around the last week or so, just quit, unable to handle it anymore. I'm someone who has never quit a job, I always stick it out.

Didn't tell my family I quit, they think the season just ended. Again, they applaud me, saying ""You did great!"" and honestly all it does is make me angry. I hardly ate or drank. I hardly slept. I was miserable. I literally had time to do nothing but work and attempt to sleep. And they tell me that's a good thing, that it's what I should aspire to. It makes me livid.

Anyways, now it's back to job hunting. Everything I find that I qualify for looks miserable. My depression has spiraled out of control - probably the worst episode in my life - I'm in an abusive household with people who insult me and constantly get inside my head, and I know ultimately that any job I get - I am going to be *just* as miserable as I was at the seasonal position. 

Long hours for shit pay, probably customer service, having no time at all for the creative things I actually love. It's going to take *all* of my time & energy. *All of that* probably *just* to scrape by, live paycheck to paycheck, and be miserable all my waking hours. And that's supposedly a good thing? That's what I get to look forward to for the rest of my life? That's what it means to ""finally grow up""? My family says so.

So, as you can probably guess, I have no motivation to get a full time job, because I know I'd be miserable. Everyone tells me that's just life, I have to suck it up and be unhappy, everybody does. But I just can't tolerate that. I genuinely would rather kill myself than go back to what my life was over Christmas. 

And I swear if one more person tries to come at me with how Christianity or some other religion will solve all my problems & magically make the idea of selling my soul to some full time job appealing, I'm going to riot.

I just needed to get that out, I guess. Who knows what I'm going to do. If you happen on this, and read all the way until the end, thank you.",1615517649

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I am honestly scared and worried for my friend's life. I'll give you some context.

I was in Biology at school, the first lesson of the day. The lesson went as usual, I sat down in my seat, and waited for the books to be handed out so I could begin doing some starter questions. The person who I am worried about (I'm keeping this person anonymous for safety reasons) is also the person who sits next to me. Nothing seemed off about them as they did what they usually did during Biology. They sat down and got on with work. We talked and I cracked a few jokes in an attempt to make them laugh. They then got out their phone and tapped my shoulder, they showed me what was on their phone and it said 'I tried to kill myself on the first day of school.' I was absolutely shocked, I had no idea what to say or do. I stayed silent and tried to change the subject, by telling more jokes.

About 10 minutes later they told me I was the first person to be told this. I asked them if they talked to someone about their issues and they replied with 'I told my therapist.'

That's about what happened, we haven't talked about it since. This person has a pretty big history of depression, suicide, and self-harm. I'm scared, they're one of my closest friends and  I don't know what to do. Please give me advice, I really, really need some.

Just wanna make sure they’ll be okay without me and hopefully I’ll have enough money to leave it behind for them at least enough to help them be financially stable y’know.

Kms with (unknown object) It will be a peaceful death. Die in my sleep actually. Of course I’ll leave a note and even lay out a towel in the car so that my body fluids don’t make a mess.

Dunno if this goes here...,1,m2vx6f,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2vx6f/dunno_if_this_goes_here/,0,"My husband and I are in our really 30s, we're both depression/anxiety cases and I'm a self harmer. We do whatever we think we can to keep from getting too low, and we decided to rewatch iCarly just now since it's still available to us. Cute nostalgia bump!

Halfway through the first episode I started tearing up and after a bit I think I know why.

Back then it still felt like shit mattered.

I was a senior when iCarly came on, I wasn't big on it, but I'd watch it just for the cutesy background noise. Nothing in the actual show set me off, except maybe seeing how babyfaced Freddy was, lol... But yeah.

It just really hit me that nothing feels like it matters anymore. Nothing. Even when I'm happy, even when I feel accomplished or loved... It just doesn't matter.

And I remembered that back then it still did, and I don't remember when or why it stopped, but nothing's felt like it matters all that much in such a long time...

I’m worried that I’ve dragged my current SO into this pit I call life. I care about him, but to care about someone includes recognising that they’re generally doing worse since being with you. He moved in with me so he’s stressed about rent. He can’t just do whatever he wants idk. He’s always stressed and always tired.

I am marrying him because he wants to. I fluctuate from wanting and being indifferent about kids but we can’t be trying for them when we aren’t financially stable enough. And then there’s age... because I’m just not going to be that young when I get there. I’m not really sure what I’d even have to offer a kid and I don’t believe in having a child that won’t have a good life: something that really numbed up the idea of having kids because I know that even when happiest I would rather have never been born.

I’m an introvert. bad social anxiety. I have been diagnosed with adhd & dyslexia with some processing issues since I was a young kid. 

I’ve had depression caused by anxiety as yearly as I can remember since 5th grade (10 years old) and has slowly increased over the years but increased drastically when I was in high school. I have had very few friends in my life but all have abandoned me. High school friends didn’t want to hangout with me  because I didn’t want to smoke weed with them and party with them anymore for all it was doing was harming me. I started going to a community college right after high school. I’ve had to be hand held with school education most of my life with special Ed classes most of my school education up until my sophomore year of high school. The “normal” classes I had in high school I’ve been clever and cheated my way to graduation because I couldn’t retain anything and couldn’t remember anything plus I didn’t have Interest in school. While I’m in college EVERY class I have been clever finding ways to pass the class making ends meet because I can’t remember or retain little to nothing. I’m thinking about dropping out of college for this reason I don’t even know what degree I want to go In. Nothing interests me and I can’t even hold my own when it comes to school education my parents have to help me with any paper I’m doing and I cheat to get by with these General classes I’m taking. My depression & anxiety has been extremely bad now for the past 2 ½ years that I’m crying everyday feeling like a failure, I feel like I’m very very stupid and can’t understand and learn from anything on my own expect for whatever I hyper focus from my adhd. I have played video games my whole life to get away from the real world and since I didn’t really have friends I’ve made friends in online video games. I don’t have any interest in playing video games anymore because of my depression and now more than ever I feel like I’ve waisted my life on them not making any progress in the real world. I got into workout when I was 16 and instantly got hooked on it and wanted to learn everything about it and got very healthy from it along with learning about nutrition. I’ve recently gotten into Brazilian jujitsu 5 months ago and I’m hyper focused on it currently. Those interests have been the only things that I’ve Excelled at that I have enjoyed but my family tells me there’s little money in it all. I’m constantly anxious and inside my head.

The pills seem to be not helping me and I have to wait to see my therapist for an appointment. On my mother’s side of the family they are all on anti depression meds. I feel worthless everyday. I do not work, I live at home. I’m by myself most of the time I don’t talk much to my family bc I have nothing to talk about. Nothing seems to make me  happy anymore and I can’t remember the last time I was happy. I’ve ALWAYS put a mask on myself and act happy but never am. Any major achievement I’ve had that didn’t involve in my 3 interests I’ve had to put a mask on. I’m thinking about giving up in life & to end my suffering bc it seems I can’t get my life on track. I feel like I’m always behind on life while everyone else is succeeding. I don’t have a want to do anything anymore for 8 months now (probably longer)I do my 1-2 online classes go to bjj and walk out until I hit 10k steps then lay in my bed for the remaining time listening to health & fitness podcasts because I have no want to do anything else.",1615507773

(very long post)",18,m2chxl,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2chxl/im_only_nineteen_years_old_but_i_guess_i/,7,"Well, I doubt that I should write down my traumatizing biography on this sub, but, to be honest, I’m too tired of keeping that to myself, so I’ll do that anyway.

Let's start with the fact that my parents' marriage should have never existed, probably, since my grandparents on both sides were completely against that concept due to fact that my parents are from different cultures (my father is a refugee and ex-military in fact) that are not, um, very accepting of each other. To give you some context, I still think that my grandparents don’t get along with each other very well, not to mention that my mothers’ parents still didn’t accept my father fully and the same goes for his parents, even though 20+ years passed since that marriage.

Anyway, let’s move on. At the end of the day, they married. 5+ years later my mom got pregnant with me, which was hard for her as far as I know because almost all women in her family had problems with it, plus she had an abortion before getting pregnant that time.

Due to her health complications, I was born too early, in the seventh month of pregnancy. Medicine in my native country is not that good, so as a result, I have a birth trauma that expresses itself in neurological disorder.

As you can guess, my grandparents didn’t get along with me either, except one of my grandfathers who died a long time ago. Like, you know, they all already had their’s reasons to dislike me just according to the fact that I’m the result of that marriage, but I’m assuming that they got an extra one that is my illness, haha. So my early childhood consisted of hospital attendings, my relatives that had «strange» (as for little kid who doesn't understand what exactly is going on here) relation to me and also of my both manipulative abusive parents always arguing and beating each other who were saying to me that I can't tell anyone about what's going on between them. They were giving me the threats, you know, like saying to me that if I tell anyone everything will be even worse. 

When I started to get older, like 7 y.o. or something, I started to get periodically beaten by my mother. She wanted to give birth to the child that much, but I suppose she only wanted a perfect child that is healthy, quiet and always agrees with her on anything. I don’t fit this description, so she just could hit me or insult me ​​for «inappropriate crying», spilt water or any else domestic incident, you name it. Like I still remember how she was pulling me by my hair for «something wrong». 

On top of that, my father started insulting me about my appearance as I got older, plus he always was putting unbearable pressure on me because he urged me that I need to be perfectly smart. Ah, childhood memories.

Probably because of that environment and the fact that I couldn’t socialize in my early years as an average person, I grew up into being an unimaginably socially awkward teen. Even more, I was bullied in my first school, so I even have to switch it, even though it was considered as a luxury one in our town. As a result, since the age of 11, I had symptoms of neurosis and preferred social media much more than «real-life connections» when it comes to socialization.

And since the age of 11, I started discovering that beautiful adult world with it's «adult ways» of coping with your problems. The first sip of alcohol, first same-sex relationship (yes, we were too young, I agree, but that wasn't dating just for the fact of dating, you know), first self-harm and first signs of eating disorder – all that took place when I was 11-12. 

My parents knew about it but belittled that stuff completely. I was given threats for drinking alcohol and was forced to go to psychologist, but that’s all.

Time passed, I was still living like this, just switching my dependent relationships with girls and drinking or cutting myself if I feel bad. I thought it was ok since I can’t come up with any other option of coping. Anyway, who cares? I do what I want, so let it be, you know.

One day I met a guy online. I was 14 by that time and all my life I viewed boys only as friends, so we became friends too. Surprisingly he was so funny and everything to talk to, all that stuff, so I eventually decided to fall in love with him.

He had a girlfriend since our «situationship» started, but I didn’t care. I thought I was so cool that he will dump her anyway for me of course, so I was ok with being his «friend»/side-chick who comforts him when he is sad or when he is just arguing with his gf again.

Long story short, he always was that kind of guy that «I’m by your side if you feel bad». At least I thought so because we've been through so much in a fact. He was helping me with self-harm, my unhealthy home environment (including my parents' factual divorce and their living apart) and I just got used to relying on him, even though now I understand that all of it was just manipulation. I really thought he is someone who cared and understood, although we have never discussed our relationships even after he dumped his «official girl». Anyway, I loved him from the bottom of my heart. That person was everything to me, I didn’t care about how strange this relationship was, I just couldn’t even feel love for someone else even though I tried relationships with other guys. 

But by the time that I turned 15, I started to experience severe symptoms of mental illness. I was clinically depressed, not just sad or something, but I was really ill. Firstly I didn’t realise what was happening exactly, I just felt exhausted all the time and felt like nothing matters in life at all. A few months later someone told me that was a classical symptom of depression. 

I was feeling terrible, but I couldn’t reach for help since it had meant that I need told everything to my parents and I didn’t want to do so. 

Of course, I was leaning on that guy emotionally, I was seeking his support and love because I was afraid. You know how terrible it is when you are a kid and you have no one to talk to about wanting to end this all just because something in you changed and nothing bad in fact happened? 

So I became very needy towards that guy. And I became even needier when my other friends started to dump me or I dumped them because they made me feel worse by saying that «everyone is sad that much, nobody gets a lot of joy in life» and especially when I finally tried to reach out for medical help after a year without treatment but didn't get it, even though I was in so creeping state that even school teachers noticed that I’m literally looking dead, without motivation and emotions at all, like complete zero. 

Approximately by the time of my extra neediness, a year after the depression started, that guy started being kinda rude to me from time to time. He could say something like «darling I’m concerned about you, but I’m feeling helpless seeing you like this», but a few days later he could also joke about my fear to go to a psychiatrist or joke about a guy who threatened to rape me (I got threats through social media, but that guy was living in my town and known my family, so I was terrified). I obviously was hurt but was forgiving him since I thought that I’m a burden for him and he has a right to be less supportive sometimes. I felt that our relationship became more strained, but I loved him and hoped it will pass. 

After a couple of months since my unsuccessful visit to a doctor and developing slight psychosis, I had a suicidal ideation episode and decided to take my life. I wrote this guy my goodbyes. My sincere goodbyes, because I was afraid I’ll hurt him (I had attempted to build another relationship with a suicidal guy, so I know it hurts really bad) and I was so ashamed that people around me will live with this. 

As you can see, something went wrong and almost three years later I’m still alive. You know what? He COMPLETELY changed his behaviour to me after what happened.

After all that episode, he said something like «forgive me, but I guess I can’t help you» that sounded like he blamed himself. I wrote him a huge letter where I said that is not his fault, that he helped me a lot and that I love him. I cried when I was writing it to him tbh and I'm nearly crying right now lol, even my best friend years later stated she would marry anyone who’d written her something like this when I showed her what I said in my letter to that guy. 

But anyway, that guy preferred to play the role of a victim, avoiding me, even though we kept talking eventually. I was sure that’s all my fault and I hurt him so that’s why he is avoiding his «darling» most of the time, huh.  I was crying my eyes out for about three or two months because he played on my persistent self-blame (my mother helped me to learn that I’m always one to blame in everything, so what should’ve I  even thought?) and after that, he decided to reveal that he has a new «official girlfriend», even though he «wasn’t sure if he should say it».

Well, my heart was crushed, because I understood the real reason why I’m not «darling» anymore and that he purposefully made me blame myself. And to that day I didn’t know that someone could feel so bad like I did. I even wanted to overdose on drugs and asked a friend, who was an amphetamine user, to buy some for me. 

That guy and I kept talking for two months after that and I tried to act as nothing happened, but at the end of 2018, I just ghosted him because I couldn’t stand talking to him. 

In the spring of 2019, he wrote to me, asking what happened and why I just didn’t respond to him, trying to blame everything on me again. I stood up for myself and that’s was the last time we were actually talking to each other. A more than a year later he eventually talked with my own school friend and was trying to fix things between us, admitting he dropped me because of another girl. But I refused to talk since I was in a new relationship by that time and that’s where my story with that guy comes to an end. 

I lived the last couple of years, changing my psychiatrists and swapping even more dependent romantic relationships constantly because of him, just tryna feel something. In the last year, I’m doing better with relationships, but still, I'm a  total wreck, who lost love/all friends, left school due to mental state and chose the university that is suitable for my father-businessman who wants me to run his business even though my father just constantly uses me. Well, at least I survived. 

But a few days ago I just decided to scroll trough this guy’s Instagram. Saw him and probably that girl he chose over me, they were all happy, hugging, holding hands, still together after years. 

And here I am, who managed not to kill herself, but who will live with this pain for the rest of my life, how I did for those three years. I fell in love with someone new a year and a half ago, even though that relationship ended already, and I know that I can meet beautiful people in the future, but that pain never goes away and never will. I will live on with the pain that was caused by my family and my loved one, no matter what my mental state is. And this thought scares me so much. I don’t want to be like this. I’m severely depressed due to the fact that I’m not getting treatment now, so I have no desire to live nor to die, I just wish I never existed at all, but the thought of being trapped in my past just makes me want to stop this all even though I have no physical energy to kill myself. 

These people live as nothing happened. Why can’t I do the same? I wish them nothing but happiness, but I feel so tired of the fact that everyone lives their life casually while I live with the thoughts about how I am unable to be a good friend, partner or parent in the future. 

I just want to live like an emotionally/mentally healthy person and not thinking about how I’m too damaged emotionally to have a husband in the future or a kid and taking care of them because I’m officially mentally ill and was constantly abused by family and by lovers since earliest age. It feels like there is no exit out of this circle and it can’t be fixed.

I find myself thinking about it constantly and I think the only reason I haven't is because I know how much it would hurt my friends, one friend in particular who is struggling with her own issues (namely, her mother having cancer) and knowing I'm one of her closest friends, despite hurting her in the past. I know she has feelings for me, and I used to feel the same way but followed my dick and fell in love with another one of our friends (who doesn't love me back, mind you).

I've managed to pretend everything is alright amongst my friends for a very long time but I'm starting to break under the pressure of essentially living a constant lie, and I am starting to alienate those friends despite knowing how much they care about me and wish to see me get better.

My housemate has basically dragged me to the doctors and told them everything I wasn't willing to say myself,and the doctor put me through to a Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team, who I have spoken to on 3 occassions but I feel they don't really care what I have to say or how I feel.

A few nights ago I wrote a goodbye letter to my housemate, and said goodbye to the aforementioned friend, but upon hearing her breaking down I told her I wasn't going to go through with it, I couldn't bear hearing what I was doing to her. Since then however, I have pretty much constantly had the thought of ""could I get away with doing it tonight, knowing she knows what is coming?""

I have made a noose and have had it wrapped around my neck twice now only to chicken out when hearing my housemate moving around the house, I am terrified of them walking in and ""saving"" me, so Ive quickly loosened it and pretended I was just looking for something in my closet. Otherwise, my plan is to jump in front of a train as I live 10 minutes walk from a train line. Again, I'm terrified of not dying and ending up paralyzed or worse, a vegetable.

I don't know what I'm doing with myself anymore but I don't know how I can end it either, despite being certain I don't wish to continue living.",1615490539

OCD is horrible and I feel like I need to kill myself in order to be safe.,4,m2kg8w,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2kg8w/ocd_is_horrible_and_i_feel_like_i_need_to_kill/,1,"TW if you are victim of CSA 


I was molested when I was 4. So that wasn’t the best start to childhood. I also grew up in a household where abuse was common and I would regularly watch my abusive father beat my mother. I was fortunate enough to be loved by both of them as well as my siblings and they managed to get their shit together for the most part.  

I grew up with a lot of shame and self loathing. I became an overweight child who showered in their clothes. I had no friends and I went from a very happy outgoing little girl to a sad and withdrew one. I have struggled with OCD for a long time but have only recently been diagnosed. The worst of my OCD has to do with POCD which is the fear that one is a p*dophile. 

This theme started because from when I was 13-15 I read these really horrific p*do stories and comics. Eventually I realized it was wrong and I finally stopped. I didn’t think it made me a p until when I was 16 it finally set in what I actually did and everything spiraled from there. Eventually it went away for a bit and I worked with kids, met my now boyfriend and had other fears like I was attracted to my family members or had a terminal illness.  When I turned 19 I got a job with kids and read a post on some website that stated that many p actually worked with kids because many of them haven’t actually offended and therefore weren’t charged with crimes, then my fears started all over again. 

Now I’m 20 and I’m barely even motivated to get out of the bed.  I constantly use my boyfriend to give me reassurance, I fear that I’m actually a p*do and unaware or in deep denial, some of my other fears involve contamination or saying slurs/being racist. I’ve actually reached out to many p and even the virped website to ask them if they thought I was one, to which they said no, non p say that I’m not and my boyfriend says that I’m not, and my therapist said I was not. However, it still is something that I have panic attacks over everyday. 

The simple solution is don’t ever act on these thoughts and you’re fine. That it isn’t the end of the world if it turns out to be true. The thing is I don’t masturbate to these things, I don’t enjoy the thoughts, I have tried to go back to these disgusting things I looked at as a teen and have felt nothing, and I see kids and I don’t ever ever want to do anything with them or even feel attracted to them. It’s so disgusting to have these thoughts that go against every thing you would ever want or enjoy, everyday. It’s an identity crisis 24/7 and I just can’t live like this anymore. 

I can’t live hurting other people with my mental illness and I can’t live in extreme distress. My boyfriend is such a good man and he wants to marry me. He wants to have a family but I just am so scared I will be unsafe. I want to get my tubes tied everyday. I know he would be the greatest father but what if all these things are true and I can’t have kids. I just think I would be better off letting him be free and letting him be able to find someone who isn’t severely mentally ill and traumatized. I can’t be a burden anymore and I just keep thinking that they may hurt for a while but it won’t be forever as long and I will be doing the world a favor. I just need to quit being selfish and scared and I need to do it so I can be safe and keep others safe. 

Maybe my family will find this and they will be scared of the things I wrote. To you guys I just want to be clear I truly don’t believe I was any of the things my intrusive thoughts told me I was but maybe it’s better safe than sorry. You guys will be okay, I’ll be the stepping stone in your lives to make you stronger. I love you deeply D.S and maybe if we really were meant to be, in the next life we can live the lives that we always wanted or maybe by my passing you can find the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, I love you and I promise you will be okay.

The above paragraph might seem bleek to some people. But people like me can't relate to anything else this much. 

I have seen here posts about many people suffering and wanting to end their painful existence. I read someone face failures over and over again. Some are crying just to be accepted and loved.  Some couldn't take the burden of life anymore. Even some who might have a life that you and I might envy from the outside are crying to break out from their golden cage. I cannot fully understand their pain. But I know they are suffering. Some of them are too young to even think of pain is going through heartaches. We all are here because of our suffering and our hope that is fading away. 

I am just one of those unlucky souls who is getting closer and closer towards the edge of the cliff. The ground may crack down anytime taking me down into the oblivion. Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, or maybe never if I am such ill fated enough to get cannibalised by my own sickening mind for the next several decades till there is nothing left but a soulless body crawling towards the 6 feet pit designated dug for me. Maybe by then it'll be just a machine to recycle me ibto something humanity finds useful at last. 

Nobody cares about me unless I'm of some use. Nobody will grieve for the dead forever. Nobody will remember my name for long.

Who knows.

My life feels really empty and I want to die but I can't. If I die, no one in my family will take care of my pet rats (I know this because when I was bedridden after surgery for two weeks, no one took care of the rats. I had to remind them every day to feed them and give them water because they wouldn't do it without a reminder, plus the cage never got cleaned) and I don't want them to die stewing in their own filth just because I die. 

I have no one to talk to. All my siblings - including my younger sister - have moved out, while I'm stuck living with mom and dad not paying rent no job no money because I'm still in school (Failed a semester or two and started my minor late - meanwhile my little sister finishes college in 3 years). The one thing I'm good for in the house is that I can drive so I can do errands. Wow, like no one else can do that. 

I'm not good at anything that makes money other than working retail and drawing. I've been drawing as a discipline since I was in elementary school (and no, because people have made fun of me for saying it this way, I don't mean ""shitty little crayon drawings"", I mean practicing perspective, anatomy, shape, form, the like, from the time I could barely write. My family is full of artists who I guess were trying to set me in the right direction early or something). I'm currently in college for film and animation. I used to love it. It was tedious as hell and no normal human being should love to animate but I loved it like crazy. I haven't had the motivation to animate since the pandemic started. I didn't animate anything at all last semester. Just storyboarded stuff and never turned in my projects. Used my surgery as an excuse. I haven't checked my transcript because I'm scared. I might not graduate this semester like everyone is expecting me to. I've been in college for too long. Even now I'm procrastinating on my thesis and I have a progress report in 4 hours.

The only thing I'm good at is drawing and I'm not even good at that. I've been drawing my whole life with no breaks and yet I'm still a complete and utter failure. Any time I draw ""good"" is just lightning-in-a-bottle success. I'm not good. I just am. If you said I was bad at it, I wouldn't argue. Art industries are so fucking competitive. So I'm just never going to get a job in the goddamned thing I majored for. I feel like I wasted my life. And I have no future. My little sister (who sews) only recently got back into drawing and she's already more productive and better at it than I am. I have no identity because the only thing I am, I can *easily* be replaced. 

No one has ever critiqued or analyzed my work in any positive manner, the only time my work has been analyzed has been when people have tried to cancel me by picking my work apart, trying to find ANYTHING and EVERYTHING problematic about it, telling me I sucked at drawing in general along the way and telling me in detail how and why. No one has analyzed my work in order to tell me what I do well and what I'm particularly talented at. People give my blanket statements like ""im good"" and that's it. I don't believe them. Because I don't see ""good"" when I see my work. I just see all the mistakes that never go away no matter how hard I work at them. 

Currently most of my drawing time goes towards doing character designs and illustration work for my immensely talented writer friend. I'm doing all the visual work in a comic adaptation of a fanfic she wrote/is writing. I offered to do this, she warned me it would be a lot of work, and she tries to get me to take it easy. I do not get paid for this because we're both broke. Plus it's fan work so anyone consuming it won't be paying us. I *love* her writing. I love her writing and characters and the way she writes dialogue is so amazing. I love this story she's made. Me drawing this story - even though I don't think I'm good enough, I try - is because I think it would be a crime if it didn't have the audience it deserves. Like me, she's lost motivation during the pandemic, and it's easier for her to write a script for a comic rather than a full-blown narrative. I don't want this piece to get lost just because it's hard for her to continue it.

When I express that I don't feel like I'm good at drawing, she tells me that she really appreciates all the work I do to illustrate her writing, and that more people see her writing because of that and that she loves me for all the hard work I do. 

So. Yeah.

My only value as an artist right now is as a means to an end of illustrating her work. 

I can't write. I don't have good ideas, I don't even have good *opinions*. I exist to just sit down and shut up and make mediocre little illustrations. I'll never be able to make something worthwhile without somebody else carrying most of the creative weight. I'll never be able to express myself in a way that anyone would ever want to listen to or see. If someone better at drawing than me agrees to the workload, I'll be replaced. If I'm replaced I'll be alone. 

I can't even talk to her about this. She doesn't understand, and the last time I admitted to her that I was feeling like my life had no purpose and I wanted to die (this was years ago) she got really *really* fucking panicked because we live in different countries, separated by the ocean, and she'd have no way of reaching me if I did something to myself. So I can't tell her these things. I can't tell her I feel this way ever again. It was so unfair and wrong of me to put that mental wight on her. I can't die. I'll just live and be miserable and be her means to an end. Recently, someone who had been internet-stalking me told me that they no longer wanted me to die, but instead to live and suffer. I joked about how I would, but like. I really *will*. And I can't tell anyone who knows me this without masking it under ironic humor (and that gets old *fast*, so I can't even really do that). 

If I can keep her happy by pretending everything is fine and just shutting up with my shit thoughts and opinions and drawing her comic, then I'll do that. But that won't pay the bills and won't give me a future. And I'm at a point in my life where I need to start my career. A career I won't succeed in because I suck. 

This was a long rambly mess and it barely even covers everything I'm angsting over right now (like how I wasted 7 years of my life dating someone who just wasn't right for me and now I'll be alone for the rest of my life because I don't know how to actually meet people and make new romantic connections), but it's long enough and covers *something*, I guess. If you read all this you're nuts but like. Thank you.

I typically shrug it off but now even the littlest things hurt me emotionally, where as typically I wouldn’t care or joke back. I rarely talk to anyone in my own house because i spend most of my time sleeping or on the game with friends and when i do talk to someone in person i feel awkward and try my best to end the convo the quickest way i can. I have one good friend who i’ve been friends with for years and is the only person i talk to. She is soon moving away and i don’t know who to turn to after that. Recently all i can think about is how the stress would be gone my worries would be gone, and at least i wouldn’t have to feel the way i do anymore. I go through the same routine pretty much every day, I wake up, eat maybe one thing throughout the day, watch videos on my phone, and go back to sleep. It feels like I watch myself go through my own day to day routine. I even used to love playing games with some internet friends of mine but even that seems boring to me now. The only thing stopping me is the thought of how my family and best friend would feel, but recently everything’s been getting to be too much.",1615465277

Not a day passes (recently not even an hour) without me thinking about ending my life. I really have a decent life but I have been stuck in an extremely stressful job for the past 5 years. What used to be anxiety and stress in the first few years turned to depression and numbness. I literally feel nothing anymore. Last year I mustered up the courage to quit even though I had no alternative job ready. I planned to take a break for two months, try to heal, and then look for a job. Unfortunately, on the same day I planned to quit, a revolution happened in my country and the whole economy collapsed within a few weeks.
I had to stay in my job during the past year. I feel nothing anymore. I am messing up at work and neglecting my duties. I am in deep shit because of that. Meanwhile the country is literally disintegrating and people are suffering. I am very lucky to have kept my job. I hate myself for wanting to quit my job while people are suffering. 
Today something really bad happened at work...I really messed up this time. I went back home and, for the first time since I was 13, I actually took the idea of suicide seriously. I felt intense fear for the first time in months...
I'm not going to do anything to myself today, but the idea that I'm slowly heading in that dark direction is unsettling, and I still can't seem to feel anything anymore.",1615436894

But what they all have in common is the feeling that **I'm not good enough.**

I go to school for music, I'm a junior and I'm not doing so hot. Everyone in my year is retaining all the information so much better than I am, and are in general way more talented than myself. I know it's supposed to be collaborative environment but really it feels like I don't belong. It's my passion but I know it's going to be hard to survive in such a competitive industry without understanding basic things like theory. And I have nothing, besides music. I am nothing without music.

I just fucked shit up with the girl I've been interested in for a while by fooling around with her while we were both intoxicated, only to find out she's not interested in me that way. What began as a cool ass friendship turned into intense awkwardness. I feel like I'm going to lose her.

I'm not an attractive person by any means, either. Over time I've managed to gain the social skills present in most normal people, but I really don't draw eyes with my looks at all.

I feel like in my life everything has been given to me and I feel guilt for the less fortunate. I love and appreciate the people around me which is why I could never end my life, but that doesn't stop the thoughts from forcing themselves into my brain sometimes.

I've been there... and I struggle every day,1,m2pn3d,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2pn3d/ive_been_there_and_i_struggle_every_day/,0,"Hi everyone

I Just wanted to let you know that you are not alone in this cruel unforgiving world. I've never posted before but I read through this sub every other day just as a reminder that I'm not alone feeling like this.

I'm in my late 30s and since I was a teenager I've struggled with suicidal thoughts.  I've 3 attempts on my record and a dozen close to attempts. I've stood on a overpass, at traffic lights and train platforms multiple times. I've cried my self to sleep,  and taken sleeping pills just to sleep through the day (after 2 weeks of doing that was attempt nr 3)

I've lost 2 close friends to suicide and what I've learned is this:

It does hurt your friends and family, they will miss you. Even the the high school bully might cry because he realieses that he contributed to how you felt. It's not easy to go around with the blame that your actions took someones life, I carry that burden everyday.

They always say that things will get better and they just might, IF you are willing to work on it. Take babysteps, don't expect to wake up and everything will be awesome, take notice in the moments that you feel good and analyze what made you feel good and then continue in that direction.

Get yourself in a simple routine, I myself f.ex. wake up, make coffee, have a cigarette and if the sun is shining I spend a moment like a flower drinking my coffee in the sun with my cigarette, sometimes I even listen to some neutral music (not the kind I listen to when feeling down).  I've noticed that if I break my routine I drop down very fast and it takes a bit of work to get back to where I was on the good days bad days ratio. I'm currently having about 2 not so good days a week and am down to 3-4 horrible days a month. I AM GETTING BETTER!!!

I know that some of you say you are sad that you don't have any friends or SO but that's ok, I've been through bad relationships and realised that I was at fault every time and that maybe I'm not cut out for being in a relationship. I don't have a pet and and live alone in a small apartment and have one person besides my shrink and social worker that I talk to on a regular basis.

Get a hobby, some thing simple that you are interested in be it cars, music, the stock market, writing. Just do something, don't allow yourself to get stuck in the darkness, If the weather is nice go outside and have a coffee, sushi or even icecream OUTSIDE! When you go back home you can see that you actually did something and be proud of that. If you have some that is willing to do it with you friend, sibling or parent even better. A few years ago I sat down and watched Mr Bean with my dad, it was awesome we laughed so much my belly hurt. A year later he died but I still have that good memory of that time we watched Mr.Bean together, so make good memories. You don't have to FOMO into it but if you are honest with your person they might even surprise you with their support. It doen't hurt to ask some thing in the way of: Hey, can we spend some time together and ask them if they want to do one of the before mentioned things. Me and my shrink actually go outside and walk during our sessions because it helps me talk, I feel less claustrophobic.

The main reason I'm writing this is not to berate or make you feel bad. I know the struggle, I'm there everyday from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep again. 

Now please, love yourself

Silly out!",1615496727

The day finally came when I shipped out too the boot camp.

I got there and it was a life shocker which is what I expected, boot camp sucked mentally, but I pushed through it’s. No suicidal thoughts came up then. I finished boot camp and went to my school house. This is when it started, theres a lot that happened while I was there and suicide is so easy to joke about and I was the hard ass that was suppose to be one of the great students. Suicide started to get to my head and just became a game, I would always make jokes and think about what the best way to do it would be but never actually comment because I was so caught up in schooling.

I finally finished schooling and hit the fleet, we finally got leave and went back home. This is when it really hit the most. I was so caught up in the military that when I got back home, all the freedoms came back again. Then I realized I had to go back, so I started thinking, “did I really want to join? was it worth it? It wasn’t worth it, this isn’t truly what I wanted to do. I kinda regret doing this.” And now I thinking about ways to get out, I’ve came to my conclusion that suicide is the best option, quite frankly I’m not sure if I’ll live after it but either way it’s worth a try. I don’t know when I’m gonna do it but I still joke around with it  and not afraid to stand on the edge of building, put a knife on my wrist, have a gun pointed at me. It all became so normal in the military.

Even though I know it might suck, I just want to leave the military and do something else, I can’t tell anybody about this because I was so excited to go to it and now I’m regretting my decision and I don’t want to show weakness. I don’t know what to do, it’s getting worse and worse everyday and I think about it constantly enough that I’m just waiting for myself to be able to do it.",1615479300

No one tells you that you are useless and have rights to decide the value of your own life, but somehow, the value of indiviuals are eventually measured by ""How much is you in terms of workforce""? 

People say human's life cannot be measured in currency, but that is only valid on ethics and moral studies. 

Human's life is just an elimination game, if you don't worth sufficiently, you lose. No one would seek for you except your family members perhaps. Those who says ""I believe in you, you worth to everyone"" are people who are spectating in a successful's P.O.V, just expressing some sympathy to others and find feeling of a relief from the fact that they are at least socially positioned above a certain proportion of people.

The corpses of people like me are just the pedestal on the trough that supports the successful people from the swamp, and if any of successors start to collapse, losing their value in the society, they also eventually melt down and merge as a material of that pedestal.",1615492418

I'm trans. I won't ever be able to have the body I want. Or the memories I want.

No therapist. No friends who could truly understand and still view me in the same way.

I'm 20. I'm a trans girl. Just for context in case anyone reads this.

I basically hate everything about me, especially my body. My memories too. But especially the stuff that can't be changed.

I hate my upbringing. No matter how much I might want to sugar-coat it, or emphasise the feminine parts, my childhood had lots of boy elements (even though it wasn't a proper male childhood). Like, I could play with feminine stuff. But I was always encouraged to be a boy. I never had a proper cis female childhood. I never had a sleepover with girl friends. I had friends not invite me to things because they want it to be just girls.

And that's the same too. There's ""just girl"" things that I don't get invited to. When my female friends got ready for a night out or helped another girl get changed after drinking too much, I had to wait outside with the boys. Cis female friends of mine tell me how they act around other girls but don't act like that with me. It sounds really entitled but it made me feel horrible.

My body will never be right either.

This is something that I haven't shared much so I guess if you're a cis woman who's easily offended click away now. But I really wished that I could have had periods. When I got to that age, I felt like my body was intrinsically wrong by not bleeding for a week every month. And even now, there's a whole culture among women around it, around this monthly pain and bleeding that I will never, ever get to experience. Just this knowledge that I can never have this really hurts. I guess someone who experiences it might have a different view but this is mine and I've never felt able to mention it before because even on trans female subs someone who says this can get really downvoted which sucks.

And I can never have a baby. Tied to the above thing I guess, but I have always wanted to get pregnant and have a baby. I don't actually want kids, especially since I'm emetophobic, but I just want that ability. And I guess in a way I do actually want children. If I wasn't emetophobic then I would. So I hate that I lack ovaries and a uterus. Parts of my body that I should have had for free but that I have to jump through hoops to try to mimic.

>!But ending everything is so impossible. I feel like I've considered everything but there's literally no easy way unless you have access to medical equipment or something, I don't know. I struggle to inflict pain on myself, poisoning leads to vomiting, I'm scared of heights so can't jump.!< I always hesitate even when I really want things to end.

We had just started dating at the time (we were only ~1 month into our relationship, though we had been friends for some time before that). I didn’t get to read the message at the time - I don’t even remember what it was about - but I remember in that moment feeling, for the first time in my life, genuine happiness. I was depressed all through highschool, and when I went to college I made friends but I never felt true joy with them. But at that moment she made me happy for the first time ever. And I never forgot that feeling and I never felt like I did before that moment, up until a month ago. I wasn’t a good boyfriend. When I would drink I would ignore her or not be the man she needed in her life. I was weak and I was a coward and I still am. Because of all of this she broke up with me and I can’t imagine being happy now. I lost all my friends but I told myself I could still be happy because I had her.

"Suicidal Thoughts Tonight, Every Night",1,m2mmie,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2mmie/suicidal_thoughts_tonight_every_night/,2,"Hey r/SuicideWatch, 

I really want to keep this short and sweet but I’m a bit of a talker, my apologies. I am a 21 year old guy & I am not suicidal, as in I don’t want to die. I don’t want to commit to a suicidal action, or anything that would take my own life, but I can’t seem to shake the thoughts of suicide. (tl;dr at the bottom)

Here I am, 4AM while I should be sleeping & while the world as I know it is sleeping, analyzing in my brain what effect suicide would have on the people around me, etc. I think about this all the time and it drives me nuts. I’m an outgoing, happy, positive person, humble, & fortunate for the luxuries that I have in life. This almost sounds stupid of me to write about knowing as (cliche as this may sound), there are starving kids in this world as I’m sitting in a massage chair eating a slice of birthday cake. I almost feel like a piece of shit making a throwaway account to write this in a subreddit asking about an individual thought that frequents my mind.

I guess what I’m trying to say, is this normal? Could this be some form of PTSD? 

My father died last year, I was never close to him. What I learned from the death of my father is that people aren’t immortal. I know a lot of people within my age group have this sort of immortality complex to them, I don’t. I always felt like my mother, my grandparents, peers, and others would live forever. The older I get I notice people aging, health conditions changing. I repressed that for a year, up until recently while one night I finally broke down to my girlfriend over it. I made it clear that I wasn’t upset over the death of my father, rather the inevitable death of my grandfather who was like a father to me. The guy who taught me how to be the man I am today, how to work hard, & how to take pride in whatever it is that you do. Honestly reddit, for a lack of better wording seeing the guy knocking on 70 years old fucking kills me inside to the point where I just stare blankly into space with tears running down my face. Just typing here chokes me up a bit.

I think that the reason I have suicidal thoughts is because I don’t know how I could live without him. I just want to know if this is normal. I just hate thinking about the death of my loved ones so much it literally makes me think that if I off’d myself I wouldn’t have to deal with that pain when the time comes. Clearly that’s a horrible selfish idea & just to reassure anyone reading this I wont & I do not want to. I just try to reassure myself everything will be fine because realistically he’s still working circles around me, so I think he’s got some good years left.

Thank you to anyone who made it this far. I guess I’m just into my emotions a bit tonight.

For those who didn’t read into the wall of text...

TL:DR - I think about suicide a lot, not because I want to die. I just don’t want to deal with the pain that comes from my loved ones getting old and eventually passing away. That’s obviously very selfish and not a brilliant idea and I would never commit to that action. I just hate thinking about suicide even though i’m not suicidal, I just want to know if people have similar thoughts. If this is normal I guess. Do you have suicidal thoughts but don’t actually want to commit suicide? If you do, and you don’t mind sharing I’d like to hear about it even if it’s for polar opposite reasons. It’ll make me feel a little more “normal”.",1615484708

I'm getting tired of this,13,m26ih9,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m26ih9/im_getting_tired_of_this/,6,"I cannot stop thinking about suicide. Honestly, I don't even feel sad or depressed, I just feel indifferent to everything. It seems to me human life is just one big fucking play and we are just supposed to play our parts in it. I don't want to play any part in this nonsense. At one point in my life, I cared about family, friends, and myself, but now I need to force myself to care, or I don't. I really want to care, but I feel so indifferent; however, whenever I do try, I feel so mentally fatigued and it doesn't even feel genuine.

I have rationalized that suicide really is not that bad. I feel very detached from everything and everyone despite the fact that superficially it does not seem like it. My life is not even bad, but I just don't care for it. I am always told that I have no reason to feel bad since I basically get everything I want, but obviously that just makes me feel ungrateful and makes me believe that maybe I really don't deserve my life. If we are going to die at some point, then might as well die now. In the long term, there really is no difference.

What really pisses me off is that I can't bring myself to actually do it, but I think about it all the time. Maybe my indifference is just a coping mechanism, God knows for what, but I just wish I could actually care enough to move on, or not care enough to end it all already. I am truly exhausted from living in this middle ground where nothing gets done.

I know this post will do nothing to solve my problem. I know it's up to me to change my life if I really want to. I will most likely just do nothing and let life kill me at some point so I am not to blame for any of it. Or perhaps I will just do things that increase my chances of dying by being more impulsive and taking more risks (which I have been doing more and more). I don't know, but I guess either way I don't really care (but I wish I did).",1615434208
Worried About Handling Cancer without dedication from a partner,1,m2miwf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2miwf/worried_about_handling_cancer_without_dedication/,2,"I was diagnosed with liver cancer years back. I’ve had several surgeries to remove the tumors, including a major one where my gallbladder was removed too. After a rather successful first surgery and good MRI’s, I felt right dating. I then met one of my current serious partners. We fell head over heals quickly and I soon got the news back that my tumors had started to grow again.

During this time, my new partner stepped up.  They became my medical caretaker, caring for me round the clock. They helped me leave a very scary and abusive person. I felt comforted with them by my side. 

Then every thing went so badly. About a year and a half into our relationship, their little brother committed suicide. This was their first run in with trauma. I hate to say that I’m seasoned when it comes to that stuff, but unfortunately I’ve seen a lot and lost a lot. My partner did not adjust well and began abusing opiates to cope. 

Fortunately, we have an incredibly supportive friend group. The addiction issues were short lived but during that time my partner had done a lot of cheating (we’re poly, so cheating in the sense of lying about using protection w certain ppl). Thankfully nothing dangerous came out of that.

I understand that that was a very tough time for them. I support their sobriety, and they’ve had 4 years of it. I’m so very grateful. That’s a difficult thing to turn around and nip in the bud. I realize addiction is a forever struggle, tho. So while I’m not constantly a nervous wreck and the trust has been rebuilt, of course I know relapses happen. 

All of that was incredibly painful and scary. Especially when I really did not know my fait. I have no family, but I do have other partners, including another who lives with me.

If it’s not obvious, I struggle with codependency. I’ve worked hard at attacking that issue head on and I feel emotionally capable in life again, although very physically disabled. 

Caretaking for me was very emotionally and physically draining on them. They did beautifully when it came to that. 

However, as the years go by, my partner has become very worn. They exhausted themself several years back. I feel like that’s very understandable but since I stopped requiring a medical caretaker, they seem very resistant to any kind and any form of helping out. 

I can’t count on them to make phone calls they promised to make, to do any chores without a request. They are very resistant to getting out of bed, spending a day together or getting off the computer. They don’t even remember or make their own appointments without prompting and help. They want to sleep constantly. 

I recognize burn out. I recognize depression. I struggle with the same pretty constantly. It’s like pulling to get them to participate in family time or spend time with me. We’ve had exhaustive conversations where I have zero options. If I’m depressed or having even small medical issues, I’m alone in it. I must push through everything telling me I’ve reached my limit and beyond because they won’t step up to take over or help. I feel so overwhelmed.

I haven’t gotten another MRI in over 3 years. I’m too scared. I’m fairly certain I can’t count on them if I need another surgery. I don’t wanna go out like that. I’ve come really far but I don’t think I can handle bad news and not have them to lean on. I don’t think I can bare it. It would crush me emotionally. But I live in constant fear of this.

We just had a conversation about it. They think they’re doing the most, but factually they’re not doing much at all. They’re very resentful when it comes to any participation in family life or the shared duties of living communally. Everything is done with a holier than though attitude and I straight up feel like a burden. Of course after everything, I have medical trauma. Feeling ill is a scary thing. When I received my 2nd dose of the vaccine, I planned in case of an intense immense response. Honestly, I just wanted them to hold me and lay in bed watching tv all day. I’m under the impression that most couples look forward to a day in bed with each other. My request was met with resentment and it didn’t happen. 

They’ve made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that binge watching a show or cuddling all day “doing nothing” is a living hell. But I know this wasn’t a moral judgement. Their perfect day would involve lots of sleeping and computer games. 

I feel very awful that they treat time with me as a chore. This is super unfulfilling.

I’m sort of looking for validation that my expectations and desires are normal. That wanting my partner to be super excited about hanging out with me and wanting to know that that that will happily make time foru me is a normal expectation. Is it unreasonable to carve out a day roughly once a week where we just spend time with each other? I would like to make it a regular thing and I assume a partner who’s interested in me would think that’s a lovely idea. But they don’t. It’s like the most boring and arduous thing to them. They physically and mentally cannot do it.

Anyway, if I need another operation or further cancer treatment, I’m out. I feel abundantly sure that I’m taking my life before it comes to needing and wanting care that’s not gonna happen.",1615484280

I feel myself getting weaker every day from depression. I am not sad anymore and that’s the part of life that’s driving me to suicide the most. It was tough being sad every day; but to not feel anything at all is what is going to kill me. At least when I was sad, I felt something; I was still alive. When I kill myself, every one who claims to have loved me will be hurt and that’s the part of this that makes me laugh. I’ve been dead for months and nobody cared. I often wake up in the middle of the night, physically and unironically attempting to shake the emotional pain off of my body. I beg and plead, reaching out into darkness for someone; anyone to fucking help me. I don’t believe in God but I pray to some unknown higher power to end me before I’m forced to. I am a burden on every one and every one thinks I’m fucking oblivious to it. I know every one loathes my being. I know nobody wants to listen to me cry and rant about how fucking sad I am. The scariest part of being in this world is the simple, unremitting fact that the Earth will never stop spinning. The world doesn’t stop functioning when you’re sad. Nobody will stop what they’re doing to wipe your tears and yet we cry. And even now, what is my point is telling this to anyone? All anyone can say to me is to cheer up; that things will get better, all to get me to not kill myself. But why? The world will keep moving after I stop. My existence is insignificant. There is no purpose in telling me to continue living when if I don’t, every one else will. I’m losing my sense of time. I’m dissociating from reality. Who am I? Where am I? This isn’t my room. That’s how I’ve been feeling. I feel like if one more fucking thing happens, I’m fucking going to fucking do it. I cannot take this anymore. I’m so close to snapping. There is this internal peace in suicide knowing that my death will finally unburden my peers and family. I don’t know. I have nothing else to say.",1615483971
I feel so guilty for saying no to therapy,3,m2gvnu,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2gvnu/i_feel_so_guilty_for_saying_no_to_therapy/,1,"For some reason every man and his dog is saying go to therapy these days. I think its great if you actually want to go and feel it helps, but why all the pressure to try it if you just don't want to or have been hurt by it in the past? Why are negative thoughts always wrong and not this ""true me"" I keep hearing about? Like if its someones individual belief that they are not their ""true self""  yet and have been hijacked by an entity called depression, then I would never try to push my beliefs on them or tell them that they are wrong if that theory is true for them, but I feel so bad for not wanting therapy or seeing it the same way as everyone else. If you have had a bad experience with therapy, why is it not okay to just take a break or not go at all? It might take me years or try after try to find the right person, and the only way I know I have tried enough is if I succeed and find that elusive therapist that is just right for me. When will I have tried enough to call it a day? When I have tried 5, 20, 50, 100 therapists? When all my life savings have run out? I'd rather call it a day and accept myself as I am, I just don't want to do all this self improvement or recovery stuff. And again, if that's someone elses jam, go ahead and I am certainly not judging or advocating against ppl doing things that are right for them, but I feel so guilty for not having the desire to grow or change myself to make life easier for others. I just want to feel my feelings, believe what I believe, and accept how I am right now.

just trying to leak some pain off,7,m2adgo,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2adgo/just_trying_to_leak_some_pain_off/,2,"I expect no one to see this so im not sorry for the upcoming typos... After highschool, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me saying she found better than me and had been with him for 1.5 years, abd waited for school to end so i wouldn't expose her as a cheater or get any compassion or anything. 

(Here men are required to go to army after filling 18 years)

 So I was pushed to army with my heart broken and nothing or no one to support me from outside the comcrete walls. 

(due to a certain car crash, the closest person to me is my dad, living 14,000km away from me, whom I last met before highschool)

as a quick summary of my year in army: It was like a possible turn point in my sad life, I gained some friends, childhood dream of becoming a tank commander was fulfilled, I lost 24kg of weight and actually gained a little confidence, Became calm, cold, decicive tank commander and was adored by some. I became the best version of me. I was hoping for them to offer me a job there, since it would've paid okayly kept my mind busy and doing a thing i liked. but no, so that era of life was over for me. 

For the past half year, I have been compeletely alone and eridicated from people ( not counting the 2 times in 3 weeks i go to buy food) My loneliness is crippling me hard since my anxiety is so bad i can't even go to a place to buy myself coffee because i'd have to talk to the xashier or the barista or whatever.. (i've tried going but i just had to turn around as i went full blank). I have no friends left from the highschool time, or the year of army, no girlfriend, or the courage to try and get any of those back or try to make new contacts. 

I used to get happiness from masturbation and playing videogames, but they don't help me anymore.  For the past 6 weeks I've been trying to revive some of my childhood hobbies that i remember i liked, but i cannot afford half of them, and the things i've really tried to put myself into have not brought any result.. 

I still positively believe it's because of my mindset and anxiety+theD(epression) that i think that i deserve to be alone and no one does nor would ever like or care about me. and i don't know how to get out there and find possible friends or to put myself out for a relationship since all this corona stuff started when i was in army and i didn't (and still don't) know how anything works in these times. 

Recently i've started to feel quite hopeless for my level of rationality (that atleast i myself think i have) and have been holding my unarmed empty hunting rifles against me and the idea of leaving doesn't sound so bad. 

If you read this through till here, i really appreciate that, and i want you to know that i value you, whoever you are. This is starting to be my last resorts of trying to reach out to society and try to get a catch of my sanity. 

If you feel like talking or playing gmaes or doing something.. you can dm me.. i am desperate for contact. 

sorry for wasting your time. 

i love you.

I'm getting close to 30, living at home due to Corona, got a new dead end job after a year of unemployment and all I can think about is: is this it? is this all I'm going to amount to?

No chance to get a happy ending and getting married and having kids. No chance of getting a non dead end job. No chance of buying a house due to the shit economy everywhere and having a shit job.

Is the rest of my life is just mindless toil doing menial shit until I die, distracting myself from the tedium of it all with mindless media and never becoming content? 

It gets more and more tedious by the day, my sister asking why don't I get a job that suits my talents as though it's easy to get a 100 grand a year job, and my mother outright ignoring and dismissing every concern I have about the future as ""Just work and be quiet, that's all you need to do"" as though everything will be alright if I just don't think about anything.
It's as though everything and everyone just sends me the message that I'm wrong to feel this way, and something is wrong with me. ""Why would you not want to live? life is great!"".

I'm planing to just hang myself when I'm 30 if things don't get better by then. 2 years is more than enough I think to give life a chance.

Only thing keeping me alive is my broken heart,1,m2lm49,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2lm49/only_thing_keeping_me_alive_is_my_broken_heart/,2,"This is gonna sound weird. Basically, I've fallen in love with my best friend. A one-sided love. I'm not even going to confess because I already know how she feels, (she's told me in the past that she can never see herself dating me and finds the idea of us being together comical- ouch). 

But somehow, in a weird fucking way. My broken heart is keeping me alive. Before I realized I was in love, I thought about suicide all the time. Like aggressively thought about it. I would have daydreams where I would peel my skin off like a body suit, and let my insides bloom like a flower. (Sorry, that's really graphic, I swear I'm not a serial killer or anything.) Or my whole body would just turn to dust a blow away as the wind blew. Another frequent daydream I have is imagining my body shrivel up like a dried leaf, as my eyes roll to the back of my head and I breath my last few haggard breaths before welcoming death. All physical representations of my spirit, soul and dreams.

Now though, those thoughts have been less frequent. I'm still suicidal don't get me wrong. But it's smaller now, my overwhelming sense of suicidality. And this is all because I realized I was in a one-sided love, which should be a thing that makes my suicidal ideation worse, but it didn't. Somehow it breathed air into my lungs again. Like I was finally feeling something after *so long.* 

Like, no joke, I look forward to the next day sometimes just so I can sit in my room and cry to sad love songs lol.

For me, heartbreak feels so fucking good and bad at the same time, and that's so weird. Like, yeah, I'm an idiot because I fell in love with my best friend and she'll never love me, and I'll be forced to hide it forever while also worshiping the ground she walks on. BUT ALSO, WOW, I didn't know I could feel so alive from something so horrible. Like this has finally grounded me, at least for a little while. I used to live in my head so much, but now, my beating heart around her reminds me I'm alive. My pain is giving me life again.

What is wrong with me lmao? (Side note: I've never been in love before, so I don't understand anything, so yeah, I'm sure that explains a lot.)

TL;DR: Fell in love with best friend, one-sided, but the feeling of heartbreak makes me feel alive again.",1615480436

Why do some see the problems of the world and others succumb. I don’t understand how collectively this society has allowed a world of turmoil.

I have made previous posts about my mental health and about the current bad time I'm having. I apologise to anyone I have replied to, I honestly haven't been using my phone as it keeps triggering me to have a break down

I have had to move in with my ex boyfriends mum, and him. This is the ex k have also made previous posts about. But due to having no savings, my immediate family have no room for me to live with them. So I basically had no choice. I had to make sure I got a roof over my head as I need to care for my cat

I know it doesn't seem right me holding onto my cat still but she is the only reason I keep going

I have been off work since I lost my place and moved out. I've run out of company sick pay due to being off work so much. So from the 17th February I longer have been or will be paid

I want to go back to work but with how bad my depression is, I kept making mistakes and getting upset/crying over little things and I couldn't take it anymore on top of my personal circumstances and my mental health already

I'm also due in court next week. It was a stupid mistake with driving without insurance. It was me driving to go after my ex and it was when things where really bad for me but I'm so terrified what is going to happen to me 

I have made sure my cat has food, biscuits, litter, treats, toys, basically all she needs but I've run out of food myself. My last payment from my work will be this week, I will be getting a weeks wage and I'm going to apply for ESA but tbh I've never claimed before, so not sure what I'm looking at getting. 

 I have no words for how much I hate my life. How much regret, pain, anger I carry with me is getting so much. I've been living a nightmare, well it feels like a nightmare, for a year now. I honestly thought by now I would of been better but I've ended up back where I was a year ago.",1615466445

There is no justification for living that is to be found on this earth. Man is born to struggle until the day he dies. Some people do not care about this; they are not plagued by the ephemeral, transient nature of life. Such people may be blessed. It does not dawn upon them until they are on their deathbeds that life as a whole was and is pointless and meaningless. I have nothing to look forward to, other than being a continual failure and burden to all people. In every aspect and attribute of my life I have failed. My time on this earth has been marked by misery and a failure to meet every challenge and advance. I have dug a hole for myself which I may never escape. I have shied away and systematically squandered every opportunity. I have been too idle and indolent to seek improvement or to better my standing and achieve something significant. The closest one can get to satisfaction and fulfillment is to be the best. Will I ever be the best. I am afraid to even say that I doubt it, because in doubting it, I may be willingly giving up the opportunity, rejecting and giving up. What a loop I am in. If I doubt that I can be the best then I will never be the best. A self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet there is no guarantee I will ever reach that goal, ergo I am forever stuck in a loop until my time ends. What point is there to life, if one will never leave a mark past his death. I see that is the case for the vast majority of men. If one has no discernible, significant impact that remains after his departure, can his life be said to have possessed any meaning or purpose? Some might argue that all people leave a mark in one way or another. I reject that notion. Your contribution must be nothing short of revolutionary or groundbreaking, else you deceive yourself in thinking that you have done anything significant. You are temporary and whatever mark you leave is ephemeral, some more than others. This entire thing may just be part of another hole I have dug for myself and from which there is no escape. I am my own burden and failure.

""It gets better, you are worthy, life is a gift, suicide isn't the answer etc..."" 

No. It doesn't always get better. Just because it did get better FOR YOU doesn't mean everyone else around you will ""get over"" their struggles, too. 
A person says they are 18 and depressed & people tell them that they are 'too young' to make a decision like that. 
And then an another person will tell them that they are still struggling in their 70's and those people will tell you that YOU are wrong for not doing ENOUGH to get better. But its always YOU that is wrong not them or their beliefs. But hey, if i'm that 'worthy' then why don't you tell me the fucking reason. Is it because everybody has a purpose in their life? How are you going to prove this? Nah, just believe a stranger you litreally don't know anything about on the internet bc THEY say so. They'll be right about your own life, because they are the 'sane' ones and you are mentally ill. You don't know any better, + the fact that you tell the same shit to everyone on the internet you see are suicidal doesn't do any good for your statement either. It just seems so fucking fake.

No. 
My life isn't a fucking gift. And no, YOUR REASONS as to why life is 'good' are totally worthless to me; as respectfully as i can say this.

I sometimes would eavesdrop on my mom (she talks kinda loud) talking to my older siblings about how worried she is about me and my future, I want to do her proud but I’m struggling with school too much not knowing what I’ll do for my future if I get rejected by the universities. I’ve thought about killing myself a lot in the past few months but the only things that holds me back from doing it is the thought of how it would affect my family. I want to make my parents proud but I worry too much of what to do in the future because in a few months my final year in high school ends making me enter the “real world” and that scares me, the thought of not getting a high paying job to make my parents proud or can’t even get a job because of my poor grades (that’s if I get rejected by my universities which I most probably will).

I’m too tall for a girl, I’m so skinny that I look like a skeleton, my shoulders are wide, my neck is too long, my hands are so ugly and manly because I got them from my dad, I want to weigh more, eat more and have more fat on my body but it’s just so hard to do all of these daily tasks like brushing my teeth, eating, changing clothes etc. Although I have dreams, I want to go a humanistic program because I love history and language, move to Japan and become a librarian and so on. There are so many things I want to do and the only reason I doubt myself is because I find myself hideous. I’m considering going on language trip to Japan over the summer, but I don’t want to be considered ugly. I feel so fucking ugly and uncomfortable in my own skin all the time. Everything and everyone around me is triggering my dysmorphia. I fucking hate going to school. There are so many things that I need to learn, understand and remember that it becomes too much. There are so much noises and emotions around me I just become mad at everyone and start hating them. I tend to blame my dysmorphia on boys. Those boys in my class who have sexually assaulted other girls, those boys who only talks about porn and something sexual, those boys who told me that all boys like girls with an ass bigger than their boobs. I even asked boys on the internet “Do our bodies really matter that much?” with almost all of the answers being “no....well yes.” 


I am just simply too ugly to go to Japan. To travel to another town. To start a new school. To proceed in life. I hate every last inch of myself. I hate my shoulders so much I cut myself on them.

In my whole life I've consulted 7 different psychiatrists and I hated them all because I just felt worse after talking with them. I've been taking meds, antidepressants and antipsychotics, since I was 18. But it's been 4 months that I stopped taking my meds, I'm just telling my asshole parents that I'm still taking my meds when in fact I'm just letting them accumulate because one day I'm planning to have an overdose and take my 4-month worth of meds in one gulp. I don't know if it'll kill me though but it will surely send me to the hospital because fuck my family fuck my friends fuck school fuck meds fuck psychiatrists fuck therapists fuck capitalism fuck this pandemic fuck everything fuck life fuck God fuck the universe I hate everything please just kill me because I don't have the courage to do it again. I've attempted to kill myself 3 times and I won't elaborate how and I hate that I failed to delete me. I used to be a college dropout after I failed my first course, a course that I really love, but the circumstances didn't go my way because we're not that rich and I'm self-destructive and mentally ill and stupid and suicidal and my parents are assholes. Now I'm a college student again but pursuing another course which is more affordable but I hate it because this isn't what I want to do, I'm still the same old piece of shit who has no will to live and basically just bullshits my way through most things. I used to be an honor student lmao it doesn't matter anymore, that old me who was full of life, sunshine, and potential is gone now, replaced by a pessimistic misanthrope who hates everything and everyone, and thinks that nothing matters anymore. I'd be doing the world a favor if I YEET myself into the void of nonexistence. I'm just a burden. I don't think I'm gonna make it, I've been in my bedroom for a month, just walking out to eat and peepoo, I'm not even taking a bath or generally take care of myself, and neglecting my academic responsibilities and I already missed a lot of deadlines. I keep reading books (philosophy books mostly to spice up my depression) books that have nothing to do with my course, but I'm not reading the required readings of my course. I just can't bring myself to do anything and I just wanna sleep all day because my head feels so heavy yet empty because of the brain fog and I keep dissociating. Nothing feels real anymore and I have no one to share my problems with, not even my family, not even the people I call friends. I can't even tell anyone that I was raped when I was young, fully clothed and haven't yet heard of the words sex and rape and didn't have an idea what was being done to me so I didn't think it was traumatic at first, I was only traumatized when I finally understood what sex and rape mean, and that I was sexually abused that time.  My parents are invalidating me and they hate it when I show emotions so that is why I've learned to repress everything and bottle it all up. I'm breaking down but I can't even cry in front of them. They say that there's no reason for me to be depressed because they've provided everything for me and that there are people who are not depressed when they have less than what we have. It's like I'm suspended within an iceberg of anhedonia. Fuck it. My family is toxic and I also live in a very toxic environment and it's taking a toll on my sanity. My life is shitty. The government is shitty. Everyone is full of shit. We are all probably better off dead so we can finally leave planet earth, nature, and the animals alone. We are destroying everything. And I wanna destroy myself because I'm human and being human is a fucking nightmare. We are all doomed but I wanna think we're not and there's still hope. But I have lost all hope and I just wanna end my misery in a way that is not painful because I've always been in pain and I don't wanna feel pain when death finally comes to take me. When I die I just want my dead body to be thrown into the sea OR into the garbage dumb OR be fed to wild animals OR if they cremate me I want someone to put my ashes into the coffee of corrupt politicians. It doesn't matter. Thank you for reading. I hope I didn't waste your time.",1615376662
I Thought It Would Get Better,1,m2j8ha,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2j8ha/i_thought_it_would_get_better/,0,"The first time I considered suicide I was 12 years old. Now I am 27, and it is all I can think about. I held on as long as I could because everyone says things get better - right? The old line that suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary feeling? But the feeling has been here for 15 years and I can’t keep going much more. I’m losing my battle with depression and I’m pretty sure the end is very close. 

I should be okay. I’m married to a good and kind man, I have two master’s degrees and a solid job (that is slowly killing me but still). But deep inside of me there is just this all consuming hopelessness that I cannot shake. I want nothing from this life. I look forward to nothing. I have no goals, no dreams, and no belief that things will ever get better. Any relief from the hopelessness has been temporary - I feel like a comet circling and circling around my suicide, each time just avoiding it, but with every pass coming closer and closer, and I’m pretty sure this is the time I crash. 

When it happens I will not fail. It will be permanent. I have my notes written. There’s no more hope. I am ready to go.",1615471253

I still don't have enough money to pay for better help or some of those other services so as a last resort I went to the crisis text line. 

I waited for a long time and wasn't able to connect. I ended up falling asleep before I could talk to someone. I woke up a lot calmer but still decided to try to reconnect this morning as I still can't actually afford therapy and I thought it might be nice to talk to someone. 

I was actually able to connect this morning and honestly I wasn't expecting much cause I had been on one of these a few years back the first time I was suicidal. Even though I had low expectations it still was shit. The guy just kept asking if I had plans for suicide and I was explaining that I did not and I just wanted someone to talk to. He did tell me that I matter, which was actually nice the first time because I don't hear that often. The second time felt random and forced. After unintentionally asking me a bit of a triggering question he asked if I had anyone to talk to and I told him I felt I couldn't talk to anyone cause everyone was so disappointed in me last time I was suicidal and I didn't want to go through the embarrassment again. He then abruptly ended the conversation by telling me to call my local suicide hotline and that he'd be disconnecting now cause we had been on too long. We had been on for about 35 minutes and he took 3-5 minutes to respond each time unless it was copy/paste.

Im 19 years old and for a while ive recently come to the conclusion that im gonna have to fucking do this sooner than later. Now some of you are gonna see that age number and patronise me saying i haven't seen life or lived yet or some other crap. If you feel the need to say some crap like this please, Fuck off. Now if you willing to see why i've come to this conclusion.... well let me walk you through my life and you see why the I choose this title.

To being with this story starts before i was born, if you wondering why? let me tell you. My grandfather was a horrible man. Im incredibly knowledgeable in psychology having studied it and watching endless videos about it. So from my conclusions of him he seems to have been a psychopath for laymen terms accurate term would be ASPD. He lacked empathy and was a saddist. He had 12 kids and he took pleasure in beating them regularly for his won sick amusement. My mother was beaten horribly to the point her inner cannel was damaged and she partial deaf because of it.

My mother, because of this treatment in early childhood went on to develop narcissistic personality disorder. This means she self absorbed, lacks empathy, needs constant admiration and well to sum her up EVIL. My father displayed asdp traits aswell. He was an alcoholic and extremely violent man himself. He left my life early but my mother remained as my primary care giver. My childhood was horrible my no never meant anything, i was beaten for thing i didn't do and for ridiculous things. My whole life i was essentially a punching bag both psychically and emotionally. I never considered my childhood abnormal or bad it was all i knew. Ive had socail services frequently called to my house and i was brainwashed to believe im unlovable and that they wanted to take me away and id end up homeless in the streets. so id act like this where fine when they asked me questions as i was truley scared and brain washed to believe they where evil and my mother was good. If only i had told them thing would have changed.

Lots of horrible stuff happened during my childhood kidnapping attempts i could go on but we don't have a decade. I became aware of the family dynamics of my immediate and extended family when i took shrooms. The dots connected really well and i made it my lives mission to figure out what is wrong with my family and my self. So for a year i kept watching videos after videos reading lots of articles and my education on psychology and sociology also contributed well to my understanding. I have complex post traumatic stress disorder people who are the victims of severe childabuse and victims of human trafficking are often diagnosed with this. Also i have maladaptive daydreaming which is a relatively newly understood disorder. These are lifelong chronic conditions that will torment me to the day i die. This isn't the end of the deal i thought i can find away out. I have gone through multiple efforts to fix me. Ive been fit, strong and muscular and ive also been highly unhealthy and addicted. Ive made an effort to make friends and have recently discovered there all fucked up as well hateful and racist dicks. I've made an effort to become a social worker to help kids like me as this revelation came to be through a weird spiritual experience while in deep mediation in my Buddhist phase i realised all ive been through was to come to this understanding and help the kids like me the ones  society turns their back on and latter becomes surprised when they turn into a serial killer. But every attempt ive made towards this goal has landed me flat on my face. This is lead to the realization that even with a stupid life purpose as long as thing continuously gets worse with no way out it doesn't matter.

Im not even chasing this goal for the good anymore, im always financially controlled im just doing it to get access to a student loan so il have enough money to buy the cocktail of drugs that will end me. My love for pharmacology aka drugs will  me rap this crap up. If your wondering thats there a chance of this improving there could be. Things could work out but this isn't the first time an opportunity has showed up just for the doors to be slammed into my face. My previous education was fucked up because my whore of a mother decided to put the house under 6 years of construction. I scrapped by and got enough grades to be in a position of to attend uni but my recent course got thrown into a bin because my house was a war zone, a construction site and resembled more of a crack den than an actual house. Ironically i was learning at the time in sociology that kids who face these conditions often times fail in education. My teacher thought me that you can be incredible smart but you home environment has a huge impact on you achievement. God has a sense of humour i guess. My mothers endeavours to build a big and impressive house for her own narcissistic gain has ruined the chance i had. I was so hopeful back then but ultimately  when ever there seems to be a way out it often caves in on me and whatever light was at the end of the tunnel turns into darkness. I can give countless more accounts of this eg when i filed a report to my local child protective authority  to seek help but ultimately got shut down by them and two clowns of a social worker told me my mother is very good despite a bite wound on my shoulder saying otherwise.

After careful planning ive realised that getting into a uni and having the money to develop what i call the ""Antidote to life"" will put me in a situation where im not forced to live this life. Once i get my order of drugs il finally get some peace. It mean i can stick around and stay to see if things could get better and if they dont fuck it lights out a peaceful euphoric deep sleep. Alot people in here if you have parents that cant understand your mental health or are making thing worse while claiming to love you there a chance you have parent like me.  Life isn't inheritably good or a gift as people claim it to be. Its full of suffering of all kinds weather your a hyena being drowned to death by the queen for not fitting in or a human life as the buddha has realised, is full of suffering. For some of us the pain is all encompassing and to fight it is a endless and useless endeavour life is an experience unfolding as part of the universe why it exists and why its sucks so much is a question il take to my grave. Unfortunately lots of children global in the million suffer this fate i just hope they can become aware of the family dynamic that is unfolding knowledge is power.",1615430402

He had real problems.  Not me.

I have always had food and shelter.

Right now, I’m experiencing suicidal thoughts and ideation, but I have a dog and cannot act on my plans until I know she will be taken care of.

I go to therapy multiple times a week, I’m following up on the intensive outpatient programs my therapist has found and I made an appointment with my psychiatrist to go back on meds, but honestly none of it matters and I don’t want to do any of it. I only do it because I don’t want to go back in a locked ward again and possibly lose my rights. If I am free, there is a chance I might be successful with the only long term goal I have- suicide.

As I sit stuck in this tunnel I can see people going through the tunnel and being happy and sometimes they’ll give me a lamp to light the way but the lamp goes dark as soon as it reaches my hand because I’ve been in the darkness so long it has consumed me entirely. It haunts my mind while I sleep and makes sure I never forget that it’s there and there are times when I almost forget about it and then it introduces me to a new level of darkness and I lose sight of the end of the tunnel.

I can hear people from time to time calling out to me from the end of the tunnel but they never want to come back into the tunnel to help get me out. I call back to them and beg them to help me or find someone who will all they say is “it will get better in time” and “we want you here with us” or “we will miss you if you stay there” but those word feel hollow in the void because what they say and what they do are two different things and the saying is “actions speak louder then words” meaning they say those things but they never help so do they even really care or is it only that they don’t care enough.

I’m 14, I’ve been disappointed in my life for around 5 or 6 years now. I don’t know if that’s too young or not, I really don’t give a fuck.

For context, I’m probably depressed. I’ve never gotten diagnosed, but in that time I’ve been “disappointed” I’ve hated myself with a burning passion for a long while. My father’s a misogynistic, alcoholic, transphobic, homophobic, biphobic, manipulative, bigoted asshole who manipulated his side of the family into hating whatever he hates and loving whatever he loves. So I can’t trust them. My mother is nice enough, and thankfully not with my father, but she’s pushy and judgmental. She also keeps lying to me about who chose my name, which is disappointing. The only people I trust are my friends from discord, and I get the feeling they’ve been avoiding me lately.

I’ve been failing in school lately. Really bad. I’ve only gotten a C in 4th grade, and now I’m about to get an F. My dad manipulated me into missing my therapy session, going on about how he’s supposed to raise me, not the government, and I can talk to him. However, being bisexual, non-binary, and asexual reaaally puts that down.

I’m so fucking tired. I believe in reincarnation, so I figure I can just restart. Load a new save and don’t mess up this time.

My friend messages me around three or four months ago asking me what weapon he should use for suicide, and I had to try and convince him why he shouldn’t do that.

But when he asked me what life was worth living for, I couldn’t come up with a single fucking thing.

People probably won’t see this, but I wanted to vent. Maybe get someone who’s an adult with experience on suicide, I dunno.

Processing my suicide attempt,1,m2d8no,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2d8no/processing_my_suicide_attempt/,0,"Obligatory TRIGGER WARNING!

I'm way backed up. I need to take some time to really sit down and process some things. Namely, my suicide attempt. My mind always tries to deflect to a place of blissful ignorance. In fact, lately that's been my default. I feel pretty stupid and uncritical almost every day now but I also know that's a defense mechanism. And now for the most basic question. 

Why did I attempt? To put it simply, I was burnt out. My capacity to handle pain was lower than the amount of time I could wait for relief. I keep thinking to myself that there's no way I was really going to do it. Even now. But I was. I was seriously thinking about it. I was scratching the lines into my skin where I was going to cut into my vein, like a blueprint for death. But that in of itself wasn't the point. It was about my desperate, screaming need for love. To be held and healed. And the only option I could feel at the time was death's embrace. A place of safety, clarity, and finality. No worries, no stressors, a place where I could rest. I remember sitting in the closet, making jokes about how I was going to die from a safety pin. It all swirled out of control so fast. My phone was blowing up. I was imagining how much replacing the bloody carpet was going to cost. The agony my grandparents would have to endure living in that house. God, I was in so much pain. But I felt a spark in my chest I immediately latched onto. I was going to give life one more shot. The next call I got, I would answer. I would let myself be helped. There were other arms that could hold me. The time I sat on the floor, staring at my phone and waiting for another call, felt infinite. For just a second, the hope that filled my chest plummeted. That was the most painful moment of that night. I was so sure I wasn't going to get a call. The last of my endurance was gone, having disintegrated at that crashing realization. And then, my screen lit up. It said ""Possum Man"" (My fiancé) and there was a very sassy opossum with a boa oround its neck telling me to acquire some taste. Honestly, I barely saw it. 

As soon as I picked up and heard his voice, I knew I was okay. But that was a very visceral feeling and my mind state was in acute suffering. I don't remember much of the call besides desperate screaming from him as they raced towards me, drastically going over the speed limit, and sarcasm from myself. I focused specifically on staying where I was and trying to maintain engaged so I wouldn't, well, die. Eventually, they got to me. Everything else from that point on was numbed. Even now. But I know that with time, I'll reconnect to myself and find peace. Not now, but eventually. Today, I still struggle. There are days where I look at my razors hanging in the shower or nights where it would be all too easy to dissappear. I hope my life has a more satisfying ending than this post.",1615450803

I was fully aware that they had past sexual relationships with others but I whole heartedly believed their words, that we would be together after graduation. 

With the idea that I would be with them, I worked hard. I got in the best shape of my life, I got a good career, I was in a great place. But shortly before graduation on their birthday where we had dinner plans, I get a text saying that we shouldn’t be seeing each other much at all. That they don’t want to lead me on. I tried to accept it but I just sank deep into depression, everything I did was for them, the only reason I looked forward to another day was for them. 

I confronted them about how I was feeling, how depressed I got. They were my best friend I felt that I could share it with them. But instead they took it as me trying to make them feel guilty and that I hurt them. That was the last thing I wanted to do, I wanted them to be happy. I did my best to trying to explain but they wouldn’t hear any of it and ended up blocking me. Last thing I was told by them was have a happy life but they won’t be apart of it and don’t try to contact them. 

I attempted suicide but couldn’t follow through with it, I am going through therapy but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping and same with meds. 

I still deeply love them and want to reach out but I feel that I did truly hurt them and I just want them to be happy. Not a single day has gone by that I haven’t thought about them.

I just want to die, if I loved them so much how could I live with knowing that I hurt someone I deeply love. I don’t see myself getting better, I can’t imagine being with someone else. I’m trying so hard to move on but my whole life included them.

I’m constantly told I have so much going for me, but I don’t care about any of that, everything I did was to be with that one person. We made so many plans together to travel, to see the world, move in together and so much more. But it’s all gone, I have no future anymore. I’m just waiting till the day I can’t take no more and end it all.

Suicidal thoughts but more complicated than that.,1,m2ce2g,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m2ce2g/suicidal_thoughts_but_more_complicated_than_that/,0,"Hi,

I'm not sure where to start with this but here goes....

Growing up I was heavily bullied by family and extended family. This is pretty normal in our homes and because of this I became extremely anxious, socially awkward and lived on edge really for most of my childhood and teenage years. I wasn't confident, lacked self esteem and tried suicide when I was like 11. Depression, anxiety and many other issues have been prevalent throughout my life. I didn't have any friends at all until the age of 19 and even this was a whole experience within itself. 

Alot of traumatic things happened to me growing up but unfortunately my parents didn't believe me and often brushed everything off as lies or hearsay. I dont hold anything against them for this because I believe they were being bullied themselves by their families and dealing with their own suffering. 

Anyway in the past 5-7 years I have become extremely grounded, confident, dealt with alot of my issues and become a completey different person. I am more confident, nicer and just really own my truth and my feelings. I fight for people's rights and I am extremely passionate about equality and mutual respect for each other.

Anyway fast forward to my current situation - my family since my transformation have a real issue with how I carry myself. I believe it stems from me becoming so free and raw with everything. Some of my siblings who seriously bullied me just cannot fathom that I have transformed into a social, confident butterfly lool.

I get constant critism at home but every country I've travelled to and every person I've met outside my family really admire my personality and the way I carry myself. I really do treat everyone the same and believe that's how we should be.

But anyway due to my life experiences I've always wanted to die and been so depressed. Recently I just feel like I want to end it all again but the only thing that is stopping me is that I don't want to give all those people who abused and bullied me the satisfaction to speculate and to continue to talk about me in a negative way after I'm gone. 

I am an extremely resilient person and I constantly bounce back from situations but I just don't know how much longer I can do this for. I just dont understand who or what my family want me to be. They just cannot accept me as I am and it hurts me so much because I feel like if I was submissive they wouldn't be like this. Its like I feel guilty for finally not accepting abuse and bullying.

Please help me with some advice.",1615448372

So, here my story. I'm 33 years old, met my wife on Tinder, almost 6 years ago and got married 5 years ago (03/25 our birthday). I came from a mid/lower class family, climbed my way through university, got an internship and a stable job. In 2016 I had almost 10k USD in savings, and as we were planning to marry, I would keep my savings and my now wife would spend his share with house furniture, eletroelectronics and everything that we needed to move out from our families homes. In 2017 I found Daytrading, it was awesome to ""win"" a whole month of income just with a few clicks and in one hour, flash forward to 2018, I lost our now 15k USD in savings and was in debt 50k deep. I completely lost my mind, trying to pursue what I lost and losing even more and more and more. I finally opened up to my wife and my family, my father helped me out of the 50k loans I made and I paid him back slowly. In 2018 we gave back all the money my father lent us. At the middle of 2019, I AGAIN hoped into day-trading, wishing I could get back what I lost in 2017 and 2018, and again, lost everything and found myself under huge loss (90k this time). I reached my wife and my family and they were very supportive, but, I promised it was the last time. I went to Gamblers Anonymous for 5 months and got my life on track again...  
The pandemic started, my wife on mid December got a heart problem, we thought it was her last days, due an infection, she went to the ICU for a couple of weeks and I stayed at home, working from home... We reached 30k in savings this year, my wife got home and no one knows what happened to her heart, but, she's doing fine now. But, I'm not... During her weeks at the hospital I got a relapse, opened the HomeBroker and started daytrading again and now I'm in 50k loss and don't know what to do.

I'm a really bad soul, I'm not happy... And I don't know what to do with my life, I live in a 16 story building and every morning I think it should be better if I end my life, or got sick, got COVID or whatever. I know my wife loves me too much and I love her too, but my acts don't say that. And I'm really afraid to loose her, loose my family, loose hope...

That might be worth saying at first, didn't think I was actually clinically depressed which is fun.

But yeah, it's just that suicide feels like it's bound to happen to me. No idea when, no idea how, but it makes sense for my life. The thought of actually living a life seems too painful and unrealistic, especially being the way that I am. And if I continue at the rate I am, continuing to live this never-ending loop into the future, it won't really be a life worth living.

I can change, but I don't want to. And I know that's stupid and irrational but that's... just how it is for me. There's times where I genuinely want to try but most of the times I can't and don't want to. I hate being myself and in this body and I can't hold relationships or have close ones and I literally don't know how to be a human. I'm just someone who's bound to kill themselves.

It's frustrating because I know some others feel this way but it just feels like I'm completely alone in this, like I'm just so far gone and I've been this far gone for so long that everyone can tell and wouldn't be surprised if I did it.

Though initially we had a mutual agreement for a seperation, I inadvertently facilitated the meeting of my wife's current boyfriend exhibiting all of the features, talents, ambitions and motivations that I did not. I struggle with the thoughts of her in bed with him, I struggle with how my son will perceive me in the future as weak and cowardly. I am now driven each day to succeed by the anger and the wish to prove them wrong initially but as the day progresses, thoughts of suicide inevitably make their appearance. I'm currently in a mad scramble attempting to get medicated before my meds run out but I can already feel it happening. I'm beginning to relapse into serious depression. 
I'm afraid of what will happen. Though I fear death, I have contemplated overdosing on something like Heroine in order to maintain a euphoric state whilst dying. I'm having difficulty in accepting this new reality. I'm not stupid however, I'm well aware most of this is chemically driven and emotionally driven. I understand motivation and most times I can fight my way out of it usually with a little avengers motivation. My dream in life is to become a hero but I fear that dream is under grave danger of the other part of me deciding that life isn't worth it anymore.

Update on this bullshit miserable life of mine: I met a guy, and he's sweet. He's adorable, and I adore him. But I don't think it's going to go anywhere like I'd hoped. He has made me happy, the happiest I've ever been in the past two years of my life. I'm just sad because a chance with him may not happen. He was supposed to sleep over, but never showed up. So maybe he fell asleep before he could come to my house.. I dunno.. I'm kinda used to people leaving or not showing up. 

Also, I got fired from my job. So, I'm free from that bullshit place but now I'm broke and have no way to pay for some of my bills. I guess EDD will have to do until I can find a new job. Here's hoping that'll come to me soon. 

I'm not happy with life, but, I'm overall okay. Guess I'll stop venting on this app. It just helped when I needed to get things of my chest, but, yknow when people are against you it causes you to stray away from certain places.

Plan to help those left behind.,1,m24bjx,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m24bjx/plan_to_help_those_left_behind/,0,"Context:

I hate my life. I’ve done so many things that unintentionally hurt my loved ones. Selfish things I did when I was free falling with my undiagnosed mental illness and addiction both running rampant, untreated. 

So I hate myself. My actions hurt everyone one way or another:

My dad is run ragged trying to help me and is ignoring my mom’s issues to do so.

My mom blames her addiction problems on me.

My wife divorced me.

Our daughters live with her (thankfully).

Etc.

I’m much better now than I have been over the past few years. Not perfect, but I’m clear enough to look at what I’ve wrought. In my imagination, I thought I could and would bounce back and everything would be right once more. Nope. I’m not a Disney Hero. My life isn’t a rom-com. I’m learning too late that some things take time and work, and some things last a lifetime. 

Every time it looks like I’m getting stability, it falls through. Usually this leads to a relapse as a way to harm or punish myself. It kills my hope a
every time. 1 step forward, 1 to 2 steps back. I’m moonwalking.

I’m going nowhere. I ruined the family I had longed for and cherished. I ruined it for all 4 of us. I keep trying to do better but it’s like walking up a muddy hill. Every setback is magnified because the ones before it are its foundation foundation. 

So here we are: I hate my life because of how consequences have taken it down. I hate myself because it’s all my fault; it’s my consequences which keep on affecting others too.

I already know I will die by suicide. Not sure when enough will be enough and I’ll concede the struggle. This will impact all the aforementioned folks:

Dad will be depressed.

Mom will even worse off. Both of them might follow.

My ex-wife will be upset. We were together for a long time. She likes the visitation time I get because it lets her have a break. Finally, she’ll hate it for the girls’ sakes.

My daughters will be devastated. Traumatized. I feel like they will get a newer, better daddy though. They need something better and are, like so many others, better off without me.

Question incoming!

Would it do my daughters good to sort of have them prepared? Like...I could tell my ex-wife what I’m planning and we could both assure them that they’ll be fine and can thrive without me.",1615428833

I want an honest opinion even when it suggest suicide.

Now, I have taken a long time to look at the world. And it's like hell. Everytime I look around myself I just see suffering and endless stupidity. I hate beeing Part of the human species and I would love it to just get away from all of them. Most humans are just terrible. They're racist, sexist, homophobe, dumb and so unbelivably selfish. Even the best of humans I have seen have such big flaws they dont even seem to be aware of. Quaranteen definatly amplified my feelings as to how I view this. 

They ruined the world beyond any repair. Climate change, Nuclear weapons, destruction of wildlife all around the world. Wars are on the verge of escalating, nationalism is rising again, the differences between the different humans is rising so much and all of that just because humans are different. Nearly all the systems of the world are corrupt and dont work. I had dreams, I gave up on those and tried to settle for something more realistic, turns out I can't even achive that. 

Now comes the worst problems of all, me. I am such a narcisistic little piece of shit, I cant even die without making a scene. Since the beginning of my life I have been a faliure. I was never the best at anything, I never stood out in a positive way. I have no social skills and I think I am so much better than anyone else. I fail at anything that is even remotely difficult and then blame others. I haven't done anything of importans, ever. My entire life could've been put to better use if somebody else got it. I have no talent and no right to take up any resources. The only thing giving me relife for a short time is pain. But looking at my body, I can't keep that up for much longer.

Even if there is a black nothing after death, where I wont even be, its still better than the alternative of a human life. And dont tell me to go to therapy, I am a minor and I dont want my parents to know about any of this until it's all over.",1615428315

Some of us have been abused as children.
Some of us are in extreme poverty.
Some of us don't have the social skills to make good friends.
Some of us don't have the charisma, or good looks to get a life partner.
Some of us don't have any family that we can turn to for help.

Basically, some of us are just living here, wasting space, breathing air, and have nothing to contribute to society, and have nothing at all to do each day, and have no friends or family they can count on.

I am all of the above. 
I am single, poor, and have no one to talk to, nobody that can help me out, nobody to spend my life with, and not enough money to live an enjoyable life. I can't afford a shrink because to take that time off work, would cripple me. I can't afford medication because I don't have extra money.  I can't afford to buy things for myself, or go places that aren't work.

I spend each day in my little rented room, dreaming of death.
I have been single almost all my life. 
I have been poor all my life.
My family has given up on me.
I can't achieve any of my goals.
Nobody ever calls me to check in, or say hello.
All I can afford to do is go to work, get groceries, and sit at home. 
I don't think this constitutes a life worth living.

""It will get better"", they say. Fuck, when?!? I am 45 years old 
People have been telling me it will get better for 25 years, and in fact, the longer I have to live and endure this pain, the harder everything gets. So no, it doesn't always get better for everyone, sometimes it gets worse, as in my case. Much worse. 

Anyway, I am now going to google ways to end my life painlessly, so that's what I've come to say. Even the Stoics admitted 2000 years ago that it's better to end one's life than to endure constant pain and sorrow. 

Assisted suicide should definitely be legal. Because it isn't , my roommates will have to live the rest of their lives, with the memory of finding my dead body.

Well, I don't know how long it will take to research, and then decide on the best method to end my life, but I will be gone soon, by my own hand.

My post got removed from r/relationships. Here’s the copy/pasted text. Hopefully this is now an okay subreddit? I posted in a different subreddit as well with more of a question format but... idk

Only one of my good friends really knows.
Many of my friends don’t even know it was a thing
Not so close friends know I saw him as they lived with me. I don’t think they know he was abusive. 
My good friend/best friend has kind of encouraged me not to tell anyone. When I was drunk I tried to tell my friends and she told me to shut up. I feel alone.
There were elements of violence and a questionable element of possible rape
I feel incredibly alone. I’m often suicidal and fantasize about killing myself or getting back together with him. It’s fucked up, I know. I tried to tell my mom but she just kind of asked a question or two once and then I felt dumb and stopped responding. I’m not sure if I was the abusive one. I wasn’t violent or anything but I didn’t tell many friends about him and he wanted it to be a serious relationship/I did cheat on him when drunk/didn’t open up emotionally much. Sorry for the weird formatting. I’m on my phone. I will try to fix the formatting later!

Edit:// I seriously need some sort of support (not necessarily from this subreddit I’m just at the end of my rope) or something as I’m thisclose to killing myself or something as I fantasize daily I’ve always had depression/some sort of ideation but I’m a wimp and don’t exactly know what to do/ was raised Catholic so I doubt I’d do anything. I don’t see how anyone can help me, it’s impossible for me to open up as I feel like an idiot. I felt like an idiot before this situation and now I feel worse. I have medical conditions that doctors have historically minimized and I see a doctor at a major research hospital for and that’s sort of... fucked me up as well (ie: my psychiatrist minimizes it/ doctors tell me I must be lying about medications I’m on). I’m super withdrawn about everything and unable to stand up for myself. I’ve been in questionable relationships before and don’t know how to get help. I’m freaking out constantly for the last year. I’m sorry for this text mess. Also I clean up well so I don’t think people realize what a mess I am?

I always was you know the most loud kid in school and all this stuff but now I feel really bad because of my scars. And you know that happened in just very short period of time. I just stop playing pc games and start focusing on myself. And starting to realize how bad thins are going. Beside the pc games I used to spent my free time on educating myself starting from 14 yo and this is not about classic definition like learning math (but I wish do this instead of what I did) that was like learning java and opengl to provide skeletal animation to minecraft or learning web design and all that really weird stuff and you know I'd never think that I'd stop doing everything because of scars. This is weird because I wish myself to be treated like a person who has something more serious in terms of mental problems but not just scars but things are really bad now. I just broke with my best-friend because of jealousy. This is sad, I just can't go to the mirror look straight and not start to crying because of scars all over my flash because of acne.

I can't just go for a help because I cant just say this shit even to my parents. Being alone with no friends because of some weird shit on your face makes me feel so bad so I'm thinking about suicide. It's much easier to go for a help to internet (I wish it to be found there) that speak to somebody in real life just think about it: I was that person who was calling the craziest in class like weird but funny and cool kid and now I'm thinking about how to kill myself because of such a dumb reason. And you know the funniest part here is that I can't just make it easy just by going to my dermatologist uh she said that ""It's okay for a man to have scars on face"". I can't find another one because the previous dermatologists did my acne more severe and I'm living in a really small town in Ukraine so medicine is bad here.

I don’t have a diagnosis. I can’t get on any form of government help. I can’t do jobs where I’m on my feet and I lost my job soon after I got it because of this. 

I’m making money by doing freelance work but it’s not enough. I’m supposed to be paying them back for getting me here and saving up for my future but I don’t make enough. I clean and I try to be helpful and polite but I can tell that I keep fucking up. I miss or forget something, I say something bad without realizing it. I can feel how unwanted of a presence I am.  Today they had a friend over and everyone was laughing and getting along so much more then they ever have with me and this friend is entirely new. I tried to introduce myself but everyone was looking at me like I was interrupting and I felt so unwelcome so I just hid in my room and cried because of how embarrassed I am.

I have ADHD and I’m on the autistic spectrum, but because my family is anti pharmaceutical and diagnosis it isn’t on my medical records and I’ve never been medicated. 

Going out into groups of people and busy areas gives me sensory overload, not to mention I have extremely bad social anxiety which often keeps me very isolated. I have very few friends, and those I have I barely speak to. Communication is insanely difficult for me it’s so stupid.

All I can think about every day is how much of a burden I am. I keep trying new things to work around my hurdles but nothing is working. I’m so desperate to fix everything but everything is so fucked up and I can’t do anything right. I should be succeeding, I have the will to succeed but I just don’t and it’s my own fault. I’m not trying hard enough but I don’t know how to make myself do more.

I don’t want to die but I have more reasons to die than to live. I desperately need money and I live every day afraid I’ll be on the streets any time now. I don’t want to get into sex work because of the sexual abuse I went through as a teen but I’m running out of options. All I have is my art talents and a body that is failing me. I have nothing and no one.

No job will take me. No doctor takes me seriously. I’m so sure my friends think I’m being lazy. That I’m just fucking around. All I do everyday is think of a way to get started on life but I have no guidance and I’m so confused and so afraid and feel so fucking guilty for taking up their space and time and money.

I am absolutely alone. I just need a way out and I the longer I am trapped in this cycle the closer I am to just ending my life.",1615394585

So today I got a bad grade (it's been like this for a while now) and my mother asked me what's wrong, this time I wanted to tell the truth so I could get help. Obviously when I start telling her I break down in tears and saw her face that was like ""god she is crying, what a weak child"", after finishing what I had to say, she just heal at me, say thing like, ""people who are really suicide don't talk about it"", ""if you are really suicidal, just jump off"", ""you can't be suicidal you have most of the things you want"". Something that is quite funny is that she said ""why nobody is telling me what's wrong"".

To be honest I that she acted like that because she care, but it hurt when you tried to open up and you are receive like that.

I hope it will not happen to you and if it did I'm sorry.

Now my mental health is back to 0. I’m giving my two weeks notice because I can’t work anymore. My social anxiety is back to severe, everything is gone.

If they deny me for disability, my bank account will go into the negatives with all my college debt, the only good thing I have, a good credit score will be gone from me.

Im sick of my mom using me as her emotional support pet.,14,m1kg6k,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1kg6k/im_sick_of_my_mom_using_me_as_her_emotional/,2,"Hey there. Its me again. In case youre too lazy to read it, theres a tdlr.
TDLR: my mom who i used to be close with as a kid has started to treat me like shit since i came out and ever since my sis moved out, she is screaming at me for everything.
I just had my third mental breakdown for today. Let me explain what happened today. Evening, i was just sitting at my pc like i always do. Then, my mom came in and started talking to me. I have serious issues with keeping everything private, so i turned on the tabs screen on my browser. So my mom was talking and then she pointed at the screen. I have opera gx browser,  and as you know some websites are listed in the tabs page. She pointed at the one called penis. Well, there we go. Now she knows i watch porn. I mean hell, it should have been obvious,  but still. I know i will get a lot of bullshit from her. There is one specific reason why, but i wont state it because there are some people in this sub that...arent too nice lets say. 
Anyways, its 12am for me rn. It happened few hours ago, about 10 pm when she started screaming for me to go downstairs and take a shower. I was pushed to my limits so in the rustiest, angriest voice i shouted ""WHAT?!"". She wasnt too satisfied.. i went downstairs and took the fucking shower, it took me about 5 mins. I was hurrying to get back so i can text my boyfriend as quick as possible, he helps me cope. I walked past her (in kitchen) and just said goodnight. She had the nerve to say,in the nicest and softiest tone ""goodnight sweetie "". 
Gah..i had a mental breakdown once i laid down. I was shaking, i have curled up and i felt my throat and heart beat. I felt like i was losing my mind. I was trying to text anyone i can, i talked to my boyfriend and my friend who also doesnt have the nicest mom. I ended up calming down but now i am terrified. 
Ever since my sister moved out back to her ex in midway january, my mom has been screaming at me. I believe its so because she needs to take her anger out somehow, and i guess her own son is a good target. Im really quiet around her, i only talk when i need to. However, she is a very talkative person. She wants to talk to me and it is bothering me. Everytime we do speak, she ends up screaming to me. I dont know why, but screaming triggers me, it makes me want to cry. 
I really need therapy, or a psycholgist at least. But she is a toxically positive person, she thinks if i change my ""mindset"", ill be happy. Hell, she even thinks people like being sad! I asked for a psychologist few times but i cant fucking get one! Im in pain everyday already (personal reasons) and she is making it worse! 
I've been thinking about talking to her boyfriend about this. Hes a really chill dude and he probably could understand and talk to my mom. I am, however, scared. I dont feel like i got the guts to do so yet.
I dont know why im writing this. Maybe i just need to note it down somewhere. 
Oh! I remembered another thing! While she was screaming at me tonght, she said something like ""computer, phone, tv! Thats all your life is, you dont even go out anymore!"" Its...quarantine man. Is she blaming he fucking quarantine ON ME?! its worth to mention shes an anti vax antimasker. I am getting my covid test tomorrow,  thankfully because i dont wanna stay home and listen to her bullshit.
At times like this, i wish i could pick a side. I love and hate her at the same time, in easiest words, its a love hate relationship. 
Ever since i was in kindergarten, i had issues with making friends. I am picky in people i hang out with. She was, kinda like my best friend. Everything was fine until in march 2020 i came out. Ill keep the other details private. Ever since that, she has been blaming all of it on horror movies, porn, internet.  You know, stuff that helps me cope (apart from horror movies, i dont really like watching movies).
If anyone is still reading this, hey. Feel free to dm me lol, im kinda lonely.
Goodnight.",1615364174
An Update to Feeling Alone (Thank You),1,m1yuvg,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1yuvg/an_update_to_feeling_alone_thank_you/,0,"After a lot of advice from people in this subreddit and people close to me, I’ve decided to cut my family off for good. 

Thank you. Honestly, the decision comes with a twinge of guilt but gives me so much relief at the same time. I guess that’s melancholy. 

My parents kicked me out at 16. Well, tons of times before that but the permanent one was when I was 16. I was mentally ill (bi-polar). They told me to get on medication and I could be let back in. 

I got on medication, became a successful professional, and work on myself every single day, but they never truly let me back in. Every time I’d get mad they’d invalidate my feelings and tell me I’m still crazy. They’d cold shoulder me because they knew I was hungry for their approval. No on ever came to see me. I had to use my time and PTO if I ever wanted to see them. 

They recently planned a family reunion. My whole family except my sister lives in the town, and it would have been a rare chance to meet my new nephew. It would take me 12 or so hours to get there. 

They booked a flight for my sister without asking me my schedule. They knew I started a brand new job that got me out of a HORRIBLE situation that Monday. They were furious when they said I couldn’t risk not making it home in time.

So they called and screamed. They guilted. When that didn’t work they cut communication. They didn’t even call to tell me my childhood horse and dog died within a few days of each other. 

I was getting sexually harassed at my old job. The people who knew checked in on me to make sure I was okay. Not a single call from my parents (who were in the very small group who knew). On my last day at that hell hole, I received so much support online and from friends...not a single call from my family. The day I started, so many cheered me on...again, radio silence. They even came to Orlando a few days ago and didn’t tell me until they were leaving.

It all kind of dissolved me into a suicidal episode recently. I struggle with mental illness still, and intrusive thoughts are a thing, but I’m normally able to bat them away. I just felt broken, pointless, like I had no value. I’m lucky that my husband and best friends rallied around me to prop me up and watch me. I genuinely owe them my life. 

I’ve just realized that I’m an adult. I don’t have to have a relationship. I don’t have to be the only one trying. The trauma I’ve held on to from being abandoned has taken years of therapy to recognize and I work every day to try and not impose it on my husband/friends. I just...why keep reintroducing that trauma to myself?

I’m not even going to tell them unless I don’t have to (to avoid the fight). I’m pretty sure that if I just stop talking to them, they’ll never reach out to me. I can just stop trying and fade out of their lives. 

Thank you to everyone on here who helped me realize it. It was a big help to talk to people who could look at the situation with an outside perspective. 

I feel like I’m a new, much lighter, person.",1615415798

I don't know what I'm waiting for,1,m1yls5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1yls5/i_dont_know_what_im_waiting_for/,1,"There is a lot to tell and I was always bad at summarizing;

Today  I find myself without alternatives that do not lead to disappointments  (without even great expectations, I never had much ambition).

On  the educational side I was never good academically because of certain  problems that unfortunately I was diagnosed late, I had an arachnoid  cyst which caused 1/4 of my brain not to develop (the part that was  mostly aggravated was the development of language and memory) this  generated that several teachers throughout my life criticized my way of  operating in the exams particularly since I always did quite bad and  thought it was for some lack of motivation or complete reluctance.

No matter how much I studied it was never enough to keep up with what was required of me.

I  also could not find a specific subject that would give me any kind of  encouragement both at school and at work (I had several jobs for the  same reason, going from stock boy, electrician's assistant, nursery  assistant, journalist's assistant and even warehouse operator). I could  never stay in one place because I never felt minimally satisfied, I  don't want to be in a place I can't even stand but I also don't want to  become a job-hopper eventually (I'm 23 years old).

Time  has no mercy, and being like this only brings problems on the table  that I can't afford (I live in a country with few job opportunities and  I'm in the lower middle class).

I  feel that I wasted a lot of time, I fell into more disappointments  adding up the relationships I had with both partners and ""friends""  (today I would say ""acquaintances"" since I was never able to consolidate  or have a relationship close enough to call anyone a friend). I became  aware of certain attitudes as time went by, like if I wasn't the one  taking the initiative in spending time together there was no desire on  the other side. Or they would get together without telling me, although I  don't blame them, we were never that close.

With  respect to my ex-partners, I would only highlight one that made me  prefer to be alone than to generate something like that again, even  unconsciously. Without going into too much detail I made her lie to my  face and I never understood why. She ended up hiding a facet of herself  so that I wouldn't leave her, and I preferred her to be free than to  feel that way with me. I just wanted her to be honest with me, I never  asked her for anything else.

I  tried to commit suicide on two occasions, one when I woke up from my  operation because after the things they made me sign, they repeatedly  made it clear to me that the size of the cyst made the situation very  difficult, making the risk of fatality end up at 50-50. I did not  hesitate for a second to sign, it would have been perfect to die in the  operating room, my family (not counting the fact of the abuses that I  and my brother went through, although nothing justifies them, I know  they were never malicious and came from a lack of conscience and  irresponsibility due to the inability to fulfill the role of parents)  would not have had to bear the rest of the things that happened  afterwards. When the operation was over I could not believe it, I felt  that there was no rest, and so after 2 days of being in bed unable to  move when I could get up I tried to go to the terrace to jump but some  nurses found me and took me back to my room.

When  I finished with my operations I went to a psychiatrist with whom I was  medicated with valium, topamax, meplar and prozac. I ended up drifting  to more common drugs by peers (weed,lsd,molly and cocain) which  triggered my second attempt. Clearly it didn't work, I had convulsions,  apparently I threw up quite a few pills and had to have my stomach  pumped.

I was in rehab and I ended  up with the idea that if I am alive and on repeated occasions there  were times when I should have died for ""x"" or ""b"" there should be a  reason why I have to continue here, why would there be so much effort to  continue suffering.

I still don't know why.

Why should I stay alive?,2,m1u2tz,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1u2tz/why_should_i_stay_alive/,7,"I'm still recruiting for internships as a junior after MANY (unsuccessful) final rounds. I have 2 midterms next week that I haven't studied for. Oh, and we're moving this week too so that kills a day for me to study.

Why should I stay alive? Why should I push through? Why should I not end it all?

I'm so sick of life. I felt this way last week too. Suicidal, depressed and apathetic. I pushed through the problem sets. I pushed through the feelings of rejection. I forced the tears back. And what did I get? ANOTHER WEEK OF THIS BS!

Why should I have not committed suicide last week? Better yet, why should I not commit suicide now?

Another week of having to be the happy person and pretend it's all okay. I have no emotionally supportive family. Friends all have limits.

So, my question is: Why shouldn't I give up? WHAT do I gain by pushing through midterms and recruiting and trying my best and pretending it is all ok?

No idealistic BS.

No idealistic ""Because it gets better"" or my personal favorite ""Because it will make you a better person."" I wasn't a shitty person to begin with?

It doesn't get better. Last week sucked for me, and this week does too. Don't say ""the next week will be better then"" because IT WON'T BE BETTER.

I was fucking fighting back tears while writing this. FUCK EVERYTHING. Fuck school, fuck the devaluation of a bachelor's degree and fuck myself (above all). Berkeley has increased my feelings of self hatred substantially.

I understand it is a privilege to go to college because that shit ain't cheap. BUT. The fucking problem is that EVERYONE HAS A GODDAMN BACHELOR'S DEGREE, so no one gives a shit if you went to college. But if you don't go to college you're fucking screwed because why would anyone hire a lowly high school graduate over the TONS of people with college degrees?

I resent school so much and feel like I am only doing it just because I fucking have to, just to get the fucking piece of paper that says I have a fucking bachelor's degree in economics while also having to hustle for the goddamn future so I don't end up being unemployed for 3 years out of college, all while trying not to kill myself.",1615398778

Death,4,m1qt7k,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1qt7k/death/,1,"I feel broke, dumb, and worthless. I talk to myself more than I should, I think. And well it’s never good thoughts. My mind wanders and all I think of are the good and bad times but somehow the bad always outweighs the good. Then I feel depressed. I tried my best for everyone, I changed myself for the better. Atleast I thought....
I always felt alone deep down, and whenever I was around another being. I felt like I owed them my life, as  our moments shared together can never be shared again... 
My heart is too heavy for my mind and soul. As id do anything and everything for love or hate. I never quite understood right from wrong til it hit me in the face. Then I gained morality, but only to find out that morality does not actually exist. Something we create to trick our minds to thinking we are actually gooder than we are bad. Every mistake and regret I’ve every had, only goes to show that morality was nothing then and will be nothing now. And every good deed I’ve ever done “will put a halo on my head when the time comes”. However, does a god actually take in an animal that has done horrible things and gives them salvation. If yes, then why is the devil always knocking on my front door telling me to give up and let it all go. It doesn’t matter, none of it does. Your mind is only playing tricks on you, making you think that all is good. When in reality there is no good without the bad. The inbetweeners are usually the forgot, and totally random outcast. We don’t choose to think the way we think, or to do what we have to do. Cuz at the end its just a headache and a bottle of sorrows. Sometimes I even through in a couple of drugs to make me not feel at all. I’m a gypsy with no real home, no real friends, no real family, no real brothers or sisters. I travel where the wind takes me. And lately I’ve been wanting to just stop. I only mean good, but that is only after I’ve done all bad. And now there is no time or chances for me to right my wrongs. All I’ve heard as a kid was the good always wins. I’ve tried to be “good”. Nothing works out for me. Constantly moving backwards not knowing where I’m going. I build something just to destroy it. I dread going to hell because that’s where I’d feel the most at home. I grew up around the free souls. The drug addicts, the poor, the dumb, the ugly, the most condescending, I’ve been around them all. However, I’d never forget what it felt like holding your hand and sharing all those special and precious moments together. I wish you understand that I no longer have any time or strength to put up for you. I gave you all that I can, still that wasn’t enough, I’d never though I’d get the eerie feeling of losing someone so close to me but didn’t care for me. So I filled myself up with drugs so I’d didn’t have to feel at all. 1,2,3 times I’ve closed my eyes to never open them again, but sadly theyre wide open and blinded by the thought of you. Can’t seem to move forward or backward anymore. I’m stuck and this new feeling is just suffering. I wish it wasn’t true at all. I wish I could say it was easy but it’s not. Giving my life up doesn’t hurt me. What hurts me is that I already gave it up for you but somehow I’m still alive and just living to die. See I have this shiny new blade here that I’d love to press against my chest. But I believe you deserve the honor to stab my in my heart and end my life. again.",1615384831

"My mother was ‘fine’ with a gay kid, but they wouldn’t be fine with a trans kid",3,m1rz41,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1rz41/my_mother_was_fine_with_a_gay_kid_but_they/,11,"TL;DR at the bottom, in case you don’t want to read. 

So I was having a pretty good day today (March 9, 2021). I went to a thrift store, bought a really cool men’s jacket and a couple books I thought would be nice to read. 

Later on in the day I told my mother I was saving up money to buy a pair of Vans, so I looked at various websites and casually remarked that I wouldn’t be buying from the girl’s section of that particular website. (The girl’s section never had the good pairs, only pink and multicolored and shit. I just want monochrome.) 

Skip ahead a bit, my mother is pressing me over whether or not I’m trans. I say I’m not, because I’m a filthy liar, and she is relieved. 

My mother tells me that she’s okay with me being gay but not with me being butch. I tell her that I’m not butch, because I’m not— seriously, I wear leather and denim, lots of trendy shit. That’s not femme or butch, I tell her. But my mother still insists she knows better than me, the ‘lesbian’, about what butch is— dressing like a guy.

Now, an important thing to note about me is that I am a guy. I’m not out to my parents. I thought I would cut contact with them until I’d had surgery. Either way, dressing like a guy should be normal for me because I am a guy. But then, I don’t really dress like a guy, so I’ve got no idea where this came from. I buy men’s leather jackets; that’s about it. I don’t wear dresses or anything. Pretty normal stuff. 

My mother goes on about how she knew it was her fault that I was gay, because she had one lesbian friend that she used to hang out with, and she would bring me along. She said that she should have known, because when you grow up around that sort of thing, you think it’s okay. She said that she’d never wanted a gay child, but she was fine with it now. (Little does she know, I’m a straight dude. Oh well.) That’s why she broke off contact with the lesbian friends.

Before this, she’d always said that she was mad at [lesbian friends] for “turning me gay”. But I always assumed it was an insensitive joke, until now.

I’m not a lesbian, so this didn’t actually affect me too much. Still she continues, “You’ll go all as a masculine girl to your new school, and the real boys will make fun of you.” 

Then she asks if I’m trans again, and I say no. And my father pipes in, “If you are, it’s a mental illness.”

Funnily enough, it seems I have a few mental illnesses aside from gender dysphoria. Anyway, my mother continues that she hates when women think they’re men and men think they’re women, and that if she could still dress me, she would dress me in girly clothing. 

She goes on for a while about how I don’t brush my hair properly and don’t use makeup like other girls my age. She makes me promise that I wouldn’t transition into a guy.

So sometime after that, I spent half an hour outside in the near-freezing cold with my dog, waiting for my dog to use the bathroom. This is important because as soon as I took her up to my room, she shit on my blanket and I proceeded to absolutely break down. I couldn’t stand, so I curled in on myself on the floor and just sobbed for a while. Couldn’t breathe during it either. And the fucked up part is I wondered if my family would care, if they would come to comfort me. Because I still love them, and I still crave their parental affection. But they didn’t and eventually I collected myself a bit more and was able to stand and clean up.

So it’s been a while since that, and I can’t imagine anything bringing joy to me in the immediate future. I don’t even have a fucking blanket at the moment. It’s a dehumanizing thing, really. I read a bit from one of those books I was looking forward to, but I only got a page in before I couldn’t concentrate.

The worst thing, I think, is that I didn’t get to finish my workout today. I still had 3 sets of 10 Arnold presses, and I feel like a failure.

There are other reasons, too, of course. There always are.

TL;DR: Bought men’s leather jacket because 1) I’m a man, and 2) it makes me feel nice. Talked about getting Vans, and how I wouldn’t pick a girly design. Mother proceeds to be a bit homophobic (she thinks I’m a lesbian) and transphobic (I’m closeted FTM). I had a breakdown shortly afterward. I don’t think it’s going to get better.",1615389572

Having gone through high school and college without being in a relationship is a perfectly valid and justified reason to end your life.,5,m1ohih,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1ohih/having_gone_through_high_school_and_college/,6,"Relationships are, what most psychologists agree to be, the most important thing to making a person happy. As such, it's incredibly fair to say that a lack of significant relationships, including ones that can grant physical intimacy through sex, can lead to a life that is simply not worth living. Moreover, sex is one of the strongest drives human beings have, so being deprived of it in a sense is dehumanizing.

Going off my own experiences, I was valedictorian of my high school. I had dreams and aspirations of becoming a doctor and scientist (M.D. Ph.D.), which I further pursued at college while graduating with a B.S. in neuroscience and psychology. I dedicated a significant amount of my time to working as a research assistant, volunteering at service organizations, and being part of a social fraternity. I am applying to medical schools now and have a full-time job.

I say these things to demonstrate that I am by no means a ""loser."" I am not some neckbeard living in his mom's basement. I am not some incel who hates women and blames society for his problems. I have simply suffered too much to want to keep living. I am still a virgin at 22 years old, and being this lonely my whole life has taken an incredible toll on my mental health and desire to keep going on.

None of my ""accomplishments"" matter to me when I have no one in life to share them with. I have only ever wanted to be loved, and I failed at achieving the one thing in life I desire. Why should others, in this case, stop me from taking my own life? I did not ask for this life, I did not ask to be born, and I certainly did not ask to be this alone. Yet I am, so why should I not have the choice to end my own suffering? How is it any different than a patient who is suffering from disease and desires to be euthanized? As I see it, it is my freedom to choose what to do with my own life, and being a virgin for this long is so damaging and shameful, I just don't understand how others can't grant me the basic empathy of understanding why I simply just don't want to live anymore.",1615376437

I don't know how to explain everything that happened leading up to this point. Mainly, my relationship as I knew it and I as treasured it, stopped existing. We were supposed to be together with this person, and now it feels like a long complicated pause for us both. We don't feel like exes. We feel like it's just that, a long pause. But there is no guarantee that we're gonna be un-paused. Things happened between him and another person. Weird, bad, complicated things. Now he just wants to be alone in the world so that no one harms him or he harms anyone. That's basically me. Plus he has mental issues, he know it, and he also wants to protect me from it. I am aware of it, and sort of aware of how to handle things. I mean, for him to handle things. Any question of the future should be asked after he moves to another country, because in Russia it's pointless to build a life, especially considering everything that happened. We both lived in Belarus, then he moved to Russia for work, we travelled back and forth, then we broke up (stupidly) and then got back together. And then Corona happened. I should have moved to Russia. None of this would have happened if I did. I can't forgive myself for this. I started scratching myself with tweezers and scissors yesterday. That's the first time I self-harmed. It was scary. I don't know how to move to another country. I just feel helpless and worthless and fucked up. I fucked up the thing that I loved the most.

I’m so scared right now and near tears. 

Since last year, I’ve been wanting to kill myself, and have been coming up with plans. So far, all of them have fallen through. Until now.

Tonight, for some reason, I began to think about jumping. I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but tonight the thought popped into my head out of nowhere. 

I went into Google street view and searched up a hospital that’s around a 15-20 minute drive away from my house. It’s a hospital I was born in, and where I’ve gone in for multiple eye surgeries (I have a lazy eye). I remember being a kid and getting to go into the parking garage. I’d go to the railing and look down, seeing how far down you’d go if you fell. 

As I’m looking at the image, I realize that if you fell from the very top of the parking garage, you’d definitely die. 

Knowing I finally have a place to kill myself is going to haunt me tonight. 

But it’s scary. I’m going to keep on thinking about it tonight, and probably cry myself to sleep. I’m just so scared, and need someone to talk to. 

(I know, it’s a bit ironic to want to jump off of a parking garage that’s right next to a hospital).",1615384840

"Trigger warning: Child abuse, pedophilia, suicide, sexual abuse",19,m1dgto,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1dgto/trigger_warning_child_abuse_pedophilia_suicide/,8,"I have autism spectrum disorder, so apologies in advance if I word this awkwardly or bluntly.

When I was 5 years old, I started kindergarten. Every lunch and recess, a group of three older students would force me into the bathrooms when the teacher was distracted, and would sexually and physically abuse me. I didn’t know what was happening to me, and didn’t know how to explain it to the teachers. I tried to stay in the classroom before recess and lunch, I would plead with the teachers to let me stay, and would cry and scream, but they would forcibly drag me out of the classroom and make me go to the playground, where I would then be assaulted. This continued for months, until my parents noticed me touching myself in odd ways, and asked me what was happening, and I did my best to explain it to them.

I was pulled out of that school, and had about 6 months with no schooling, until I was placed in a new school towards the end of the year. Because what had happened was so traumatic, I became completely unable to remember it. I still can’t remember it, I can only go off of what my parents have told me, when I asked them what happened. But when I was assessed by a counsellor as a kid, because I couldn’t remember what happened, the counsellor concluded it hadn’t affected me, and that I was fine and didn’t need therapy. So the trauma went completely untreated for 15 years, until early in 2020, when I had a complete emotional breakdown due to a number of factors, and a whole lot of repressed grief, shame, rage, self-hatred, pain and terror came rushing into my conscious awareness, and I had to be hospitalized after a suicide attempt.

In the aftermath of that, I googled my symptoms, and found that they all lined up perfectly with Complex PTSD. Not only that, but it also explained a bunch of other stuff I could never explain before. For my whole life, I have never been able to feel joy to the same intensity as others, and I have never seen any inherent value in being alive, but I have always felt anger, sadness and fear far more intensely than is appropriate, often having massive breakdowns over seemingly minor things. I have also had roughly 15 minute episodes that happen randomly, where I am still conscious, but everything in the world seems to be somehow not real, as if I’m inside of a simulated world, or as if everything is made of plastic, or a hologram. And I also have this deep sense of isolation, I feel that I don’t qualify as a human being, I feel that I am defective, warped, twisted, disgusting and inhuman. I feel that I am deeply wrong on a fundamental level, that I am undeserving of any love, and that I can never truly, meaningfully connect with anyone. And also the inability to remember the event itself, having flashbacks to the emotional state I was in during the event, but not actually being able to remember what happened, is a big red flag for Complex PTSD. So, I explained all this to my psychologist and psychiatrist, and they agreed, yes, it’s Complex PTSD, and diagnosed me. Technically the diagnosis is PTSD, as Complex PTSD is considered a subcategory, not a separate disorder.

Anyway, I was relieved to finally have a word for what the hell was wrong with me, but that’s sort of only the beginning. I’ve been trudging through paperwork to try to get financial support, but it has paid off, and in April I will be starting fortnightly appointments with a psychotherapist specifically focusing on the Complex PTSD. It will likely take several years, but I’m ready and willing to do it. I hope that I will be able to remember the events at least a little, that I will be able to process them emotionally, and that I will be able to feel safe, and regain the ability to feel a normal level of happiness, to regain the will to be alive, and to regain the ability to love myself and consider myself human.

But this whole thing also seriously fucked my sexuality up. When I was 12 years old, I started to experience sexual feelings, and accidentally discovered that I was aroused by pre-pubescent children, and by animals. And not by teenage or adult humans. So I was understandably terrified of myself. I told my parents about this, they took me to the psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist basically told me ‘there’s nothing we can do, you’re just stuck with it’. They said it less bluntly than that, but that’s what I got from it. They were very dismissive. But I was so ashamed of these feelings and these fantasies. I live in a rural area, so whenever we would drive past cows, horses or sheep, I would get hard and would start feeling absolutely horrible about myself. I was so afraid that I might touch a real animal or child, and for many reasons, but most of all this one, I wanted to kill myself. I attempted suicide several times throughout high school. It didn’t help that my friends (who didn’t know about this of course) constantly made jokes about how furries should be executed, which reinforced my view that I should be dead.

Since I’ve left high school, I’ve kind of come to terms with it, but it still upsets me. I know at this stage that I’m no threat to anyone. I would never touch a real child or a real animal in a sexual way, and I would never watch pornography of real children or real animals, since that is supporting the abuse of them. So I’m confident that I’m not going to hurt anyone. But I still can’t help but hate myself for it from time to time. It’s just so disgusting. I wish I was attracted to anything else, just not that. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t still tempted to kill myself from time to time. Who wouldn’t be?

I admit I do look at drawings of fictional animal characters, and drawings of fictional child characters, on my computer. I figure that way, I can release my pent up urges without hurting any real people or animals. I also look at photos or videos of real animals which were not originally taken for pornographic purposes, since those don’t financially support animal abuse (whereas bestiality porn does support animal abuse). I feel this is a reasonable compromise where I’m not hurting anyone but I still have some sexual expression in my life. But I’m also terrified.

I have a scenario I constantly play over and over in my head. Where I get arrested for the cartoon porn, and get sent to jail, and I get raped in jail because the inmates and guards don’t care about the nuance or the difference between someone who looks at cartoons and someone who rapes kids, and they would rape me anyway. I think this scenario itself is kind of a flashback to the emotions I had when I was abused. Powerlessness. Terror. Pain. All that kind of shit. It’s really scary and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m constantly afraid that any second, the police will burst through the door and drag me away, and I’ll be raped over and over in prison for years with no escape. I’m terrified.

Right now, I don’t want to kill myself, because I know it would upset my parents. But once my parents die of old age, I plan to kill myself. I believe I am a completely worthless subhuman. I don’t add anything positive to the world. And I’m so terrified that everyone is out to hurt me and rape me. If they knew about the drawings I look at, I fear that all the people in my day to day life wouldn’t hesitate to bash me to death and rape me. I don’t trust anyone. I’m absolutely terrified. I can’t escape this cycle of fear. If it wasn’t for my parents, I would kill myself right now.",1615345149

I just can take it anymore. I thought I was doing good but as my last post said a couple days ago my best friend the person I literally held on a pedestal I worshipped her becuase she accepted me cared about me and she always called me the gender I preferred to go by which is he/him they/them. When she heard about the self harm she snapped at me said alot of things which at first it didn't really bother me I mean all those things I had already said to myself multiple times. But then she brought up the time I went to the hospital because I told her I was sick. It was a suicide attempt. I overdosed on my medicine but I survived which I didnt really lie because I was sick. But, she said I lied about that and am probably lying about this too. I forgot about it until I got home and all of it came rushing to my head. I couldn't breathe or move I just felt myself falling to the ground unable to get up I was paralyzed. I was crying so hard my eyes we're red and blurry and I kept trying to stop but I couldn't bring myself to get up. I was hyperventilating and I was getting dizzy. After maybe 15 minutes I was at least better then I was and I went to look at myslef in the mirror and I couldn't stand it. I tried to kill myself again but this time I tried to slit my wrist I wanted to die in the most painful way I could think of. It is what I deserved I was horrible person. No one cared about me. My family hates me becuase of all I put them through with me needing medicine refills and I feel like it would be better if I didn't exsist. I started to lower the blade to my wrist but then my mother rushes in and you would think oh I don't she would start crying maybe hug me tell me it was going to be already say something positive. She walks in looks at me tells me I am such an attention hog and says ""If your going to do it do it and be done with it. Your so dramatic."" I hate my house. I know I chase so much stress on them but even I don't think I deserve that. I don't want to continue living like this. Hell I don't want to continue living. I am sorry for those who encouraged me to keep going I said I could do it to myself I promised I could o it but I just couldn't I let everyone down like I always do. I know if I died I would not be missed.  I don't think I can continue living. I don't care if it is stupid or cheesy but I just want someone, anyone to tell me that I can do it. That I can be ok. That I can make it through this. I haven't heard someone say they love and and are proud on me since the second grade. I don't care if it sounds dumb or stupid or cheesy I just want someone to say I will be alright and actually mean it. I want someone to say they are proud of me or they love me and not just say it to say it I want them to mean it when they say it. Thank you everyone for listening.",1615366248

I'm going to kill myself one day,3,m1ny51,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1ny51/im_going_to_kill_myself_one_day/,1,"I've been alone for 10 years and the friends i had all hurt me badly. They cursed, threatened and stole from me and those who didn't simply abandon me all together so i thought was alone for around 6 years before trying online communication thinking it would be different. I was very wrong, it's just the same and worse at times because at least in real life you can tell if someone is lying to you or just pretending. Every single person who've I've talked to has lied about caring about me and always put the blame on me despite it being me who was pouring my heart out to them and doing the best that i could for them. I've only been betrayed over and over again and i can't take it anymore. The only reason why i don't kill myself now is because of my my mom, she is the only person that I have that still cares about me but when she's gone I'll be alone in this world where it seems i can only find hateful and selfish people who are hellbent on hurting me and everyone else around them. You might be wondering why I'm typing this then, it's because I'm scared of no one knowing anything about me. My biggest fear is being forgotten and if i can't leave memories behind then I'll leave my reasoning, warnings and advice for those who are like me. My first warning would be is to never get close to anyone online no matter who they are. If you've never met them in real life then you cannot trust them and you mustn't because one day they will hurt you. Second, don't help anyone unless they've helped you first. Oftentimes I would end up being the one helping others despite me being the one who asked for help in the first place and even though I did my best to help I got nothing in return maybe even money not much $5 here and there for steam games and such to try and make someone happy and play with them but in the end I was the one who was hurt badly. My third piece of advice is a little controversial I guess you could say and it's to never join the furry fandom for community. If you were thinking about being a furry don't what's the biggest mistake I ever made not only do most people already hate them the community itself is a cesspool of toxicity in fact the most hateful people I met were furries who were in the community for five years plus and who had fursuits. I'm sure there are good people in this community but most are destructive, they may seem like that isn't true a lot of them will try and say ""well that's just a minority"" I can safely say in my case that isn't true it's honestly the majority. So if you're looking for a community to join I would avoid furries and look elsewhere for people with common interest. My last piece of advice is to never go online asking for help or advice. I know that most people who are depressed and dealing with tough situations often look anywhere for some kind of help or release and in most cases turn to online chats. But this is a serious mistake often times either people will outright tell you that your problems are irrelevant or people will pretend that they want to help you only to use your weaknesses against you in some way to either hurt you or manipulate you. I've never been properly helped and I've even gone to doctors in real life so in my opinion the best way to cope with hard situations is to try and ignore them the best you can and deal with them the best you can until they are resolved or no longer a problem. Going to family members is also not a bad idea but in some cases family members May react negatively to mention of depression or sadness. That's all I have to say for now unless I appear in the comments for some reason I hope you all have a good day and a good life.",1615374813
I Inject air into my veins,2,m1q926,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1q926/i_inject_air_into_my_veins/,3,"Today I tried to inject 60 milliliters of air into my veins, I took three attempts three times I put the needle in my veins but I succeeded, I injected the 60 milliliters of air into my veins, I felt how the air go for my veins and even heard how it created bubbles in my arm, I felt freer than ever.  so I lay down on the bed and closed my eyes as I anxiously awaited my death.

 I felt 0 pain from that moment on, the sensation was strange but 0 painful, it can be said that the only painful thing was the little Needle entering my skin, it even felt relaxing, I had a hard time breathing like I was tired, my heartbeat was accelerated and I felt like my body wanted to get rid of the air as soon as possible, I began to have a kind of belching but not of air coming out of my stomach but from my lungs, it exhaled more air than it inhaled.

  the songs from the play list for ""sad people"" passed and every second I worried more and more as my heart was beating dry and the air was expelled from my system through the lungs, I had not cried at all until that moment, that  moment in which I realized that, I was still alive ...

While I cried and was traumatized with the horrible sensation of being alive, I began to feel less those air bubbles in my chest, my heartbeat normalized, I began to breathe fluently and from having those strange burps and the songs on the playlist were over,  I just failed.

 I never felt worse than at that moment while I was waiting for death and I saw how it went wrong, I just repeated in my head ""I don't want this to be an attempt"" damn it, until I wrote a super philosophical suicide note  ... Anyway  the rest of the day I had a very mild headache, but very very mild.

 If it had worked, I would have given it a 1 out of 10 on the pain scale, I still don't know what went wrong, maybe I should have injected the air faster, because I read that the amount necessary to be fatal is at least 50 milliliters  I put 60 cause ""more is better"" but nothing :(

 The next maybe I'll try 120 (two Injections because my syringe is 60 Max) and I will do it faster so that the air does not disperse and everything is done together, although, as much as possible, if that does not work, then I have to investigate what other  legal or illegal substance can kill me painlessly if injected.

no one else to tell.,2,m1tasl,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1tasl/no_one_else_to_tell/,1,"i just want to tell someone. i make a lot of suicide jokes, depression jokes, i meme around with my friends. we're all early twenties and in varying positions of mental illness, stress from covid and life in general, and its well known and easily discussed that none of us are doing particularly well.

but we kinda all assume that we're... surviving. we're going to be okay eventually. someone might make a joke about not wanting to deal with life anymore but we have this mutual understanding that they're *jokes*, to cope.

lately I've been noticing that... im thinking about it. im thinking about it in a serious way, in a 'what should be in my will', 'what should i do with the savings i have before i end it' way. in a 'it doesnt matter what choice i make here because i wont be there for the consequences' way. maybe im even sabotaging myself and making choices of which the consequences i dont WANT to see.

and i cant tell anyone. i cant put this on anyone. i cant tell people 'hey, im thinking of killing myself so have fun living in fear every day of maybe waking up to the call that im gone!'. ive been through that, that call. ive been with friends who had to deal with that call. i dont want to be that person but i dont know how much longer i can put it off.

i wanted to go until 27 but i dont even know if i can make it that far. 

ive been in counselling but its shit, it doesnt help.

ive been on meds but they started scaring me and i feel so much more (positive, too) now.

i got referred to an actual psychiatrist but they didnt accept me because 'i have no trauma to talk about' (i have long term amnesia until about 18 y/o).

im not going to be able to get my degree and im not getting enough out of work to live comfortably without the degree (im a freelancer). i dont know what the fuck to do from here.

But I think about it everyday 

I think about the girl I was

And how long it took for me to get there

And how hard it was

But it was like everybody hated seeing me happy

And they just broke me down 

I’m scared to feel excited 

I’m scared to love 

I’m just really scared about everything

It’d be a huge weight off my shoulders

Now I see life is bearable

I just don’t want to live in it

I close my eyes and imagine sometimes

Jumping off and feeling everything

Fall off my shoulders

And I’m completely weightless and happy and free again 

I don’t know if I can ever be that girl again 

I try but I really don’t know if I can 

I continue to live because

I can’t bring that pain to my family or those around me

A contemplation on suicide,1,m1sau2,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1sau2/a_contemplation_on_suicide/,1,"I've changed my view on suicide from a sign of weakness or a consequence of mental illness to a choice. A bad one, maybe, but still a choice that should be respected if one decides to choose it.
I do love to die, for various reasons. I've thought about every consequence possible, about how it effects other people and such things. Here's what I've come to realize:
--
Other people's sadness is not a problem for me: I've understood that other people's sadness is not my responsibility. I do not owe my parents of friends anything. They do not owe me anything as well. If one of them commits suicide, I'll be sad - probably- , but respect their choice and understand that they are not responsible for my sadness and can do as they see fit. I want others to do the same for me. If I don't kill myself for the sake of others, my life then belongs to those others, not myself. I do not want that. 
--
You may say that things might get better. Well they may actually do. I don't want to discard any possibility. But it's a bet. Will happiness be enough to make up for all the suffering? What if things don't get better? The dissapointemt would hurt you more that anything. And will the happiness be so much so it can be better than the comfort of not existing?
--
What holds me back is the uncertainty of the action. There is a lot of room for things to go wrong. Whatever plan that you have may not work, you may end up with disabilities for the rest of your life, and you should go through much more than you are already going through. I've read and researched different methods and none of them are reliable enough. That's what's holding me back. If only you could press a key and be done with it...
--
I'm 18 and suicide has been in my mind for a couple of years. It's been more intense than before recently. I'm in a position in which I can't kill myself (yet) but I can't also lead a good life. All I can do is to watch everything get worse because I both lack the courage to leave, and the courage to stay.

For the past 1 year I have been feeling low and contemplating suicide everyday. This feeling turned me into a completely different person.I was rude and mean and behaved badly with people who really cared. To them, I am sorry for my behaviour and all the things I did/said. Forgive me. I was in a bad place but that does not give me an excuse to act out.
Probably none of my friends/family will ever read this post. Maybe no one on this sub will ever read this post but I had to say my sorry.

To the person who adopted me,I love you beyond anything. You were so nice but I never quite appreciated you. You were my isolation and I messed up😭. I will miss you the most. Remember the good memories and forgive the bad ones.

To everyone else, I will miss you people but I have to go or I will mess up more than ever. This is my final message and no one will ever hear from me after this. Goodbye World.

But I hate it. I hate not being dead. I hate having to continue to live but I don’t have the drive to actually go though with suicide anymore.

I always was reading that people who attempt suicide and live are so happy that they kept living. But I don't feel that anymore at all. Its been eight days since I tried to kill myself. After the immediate like shock feeling wore off I sat with the weird feelings and thought that maybe I should give myself a week and really try to have things be better but there's no getting better. And I want to die more and more everyday. Everyday that I wake up feels wrong, like it's a day where I shouldn't be here anymore but I am. It feels like I shouldn't exist right now.

I'm sorry I'm posting this from a throwaway because I feel like I'm just saying too much about myself and I'm not sure if anyone in my life knows my reddit account.

The really fucked up thing that just feels so weird is that last night I called a suicide hotline and the most pleasant, nicest person answered. And they talked to me for so long and just listened and weren't judgmental and was kind. But it still didn't help at all. And I know that a phone call isn't gonna miraculously fix my life but it fucks me up that I can see such a good positive thing and take nothing away from it. 

I feel so forgotten, alone, and broken. And I'm scared to talk to anyone about it. Because what if I say something and they just don't give a shit at all? What do I do then? I'm scared to even post this because it'll probably just get lost completely to the void.

I don't know what to do anymore. I really really can't picture myself being around soon.

What do I have to show for my life? 21 years of just being weird, awkward and stupid.

There's no more joy, everything is just sadness, anxiety, dullness, eating disorder, panic, tiredness, pain.

What's the point?

I'm sorry this is so long and pointless if you read it, I'm sorry for wasting time

I Am Scared,3,m1leqe,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1leqe/i_am_scared/,1,"So, this is very long, but I feel like I've been on the edge for the last few days, and I feel like I am about to jump.

For the last three months or so, I have felt a very strong suicidal ideation. I have been seeing a therapist since the beginning of that period, and I am now trying to use a natural solution like Saint John's Wort to maybe take the edge off of what I am realizing is a pretty harsh depression and serious anxiety. The last few days, however, I have felt hopeless. 

It is a very long story from my perspective. Basically, I have struggled to find employment for the last four years or so. After I graduated from college it started off as me being too picky and looking for something in my field. Then, after my parents got me a job at a call center to collect debts in 2017, I lasted maybe a month before I just panicked and quit. I suffered from anxiety all my life, and at different moments it gets extreme. After that job, I have been going through cycles of looking for work, having an interview or two, not getting the job, then becoming demoralized to the point where I stop looking. Some time passes and my parents get angry at me, I start looking again. Rinse and repeat. I went to graduate school from January 2018 to December 2020 and got my degree in history in the hopes of maybe getting something in my field. 

When the pandemic hit I generally stopped looking for work. A part of it was that I was in the middle of working on my master's thesis and it was a lot of work to get it finished. Another part of it was that I didn't want to start a job in the middle of the pandemic. Finally, my grandmother was losing her long fight with breast cancer and was given months to live. I wanted to spend as much time as possible with her before she passed. She passed away in August 2020. After her death, my parents started to push me to look for work, and rightly so. However, looking for work has been one of the biggest causes of anxiety. I was afraid of a repeat of what happened at the call center happening again, and on top of that emotionally I just did not have motivation. Finally, in November 2020, my Dad had some hope for a position. His company was hiring for a factory position to package their product. I was hired, but the onboarding process took nearly a month. This is where it feels like my life spiraled out of control for me.

The drug test was a disaster. I could not pee in a cup, and after being stuck in the waiting room downing water, I threw up in my mask, and then after continuing to drink, I soiled myself in both ways. Basically, I had a breakdown. I drove to a nearby park before my parents got home and called the Suicide Hotline. I had another chance and the drug test went well. I was going to start this job finally, about a week before Christmas. This is where things got really bad. I had started Lexapro after this incident, so I was only on it for about a week when I started. I thought I had a good first day, but it was very physical and fast-paced. I am not a physical person. I am extremely overweight, and I am a really anxious person who is not used to multitasking. On top of that, I had just finished getting my master's degree, and I felt like I was digging ditches. I started work on a Friday. Two days later, on Sunday, December 20, when I realized I would be going back in the next day, I freaked out. I got my car keys, took a knife, and went into my car. I tried to back out of my driveway but the snow was blocking me. In my head, I was going to kill myself, but I didn't have an exact plan. My Dad ran out of the house and got me out of the car, and I was melting down, basically. I stopped taking the Lexapro.

Christmas came and went, and I started thinking about my future. I started seeing a therapist, who I think has helped me. Then, my dog Chewie passed away on January 4. He had been in my life since I was twelve. His death came as a shock to me. I knew he was going to die at some point, but I had in my head a timescale of months or a year. My grandmother's death was like that, and it came as no shock. But this was. After he died I have felt like I have been going downhill emotionally. I have been putting on a smile and I am able to act normal in front of people, but deep down I have been feeling worthless. I see household appliances and imagine ways of killing myself with them. I have even practiced wrapping my headphones around my neck and choking myself to death. Even though I am trying things to help myself out, like walking most days with my grandfather, writing a positivity journal, and more. It is why about two weeks ago I started Saint John's Wort. 

The last week or so has been especially difficult. I've been nervous about looking for work again. Incredibly self-conscious about my not having a job. What's more, I got my degree in the mail a few weeks ago and we were going to have a nice Sunday dinner to celebrate. My Mom proposed pushing it off so we can go out and eat at a restaurant. I had no good arguments against it, but I needed that celebration for some sense of closure. I've had really bad dreams recently as well. I am very overweight, twenty-six and without a job, depressed, anxious, motivated to do little, and I'm putting up a facade to seem not depressed. I feel weird bringing it up in front of them. And now I am increasingly feeling like I need to end my life, especially since tonight my Mom sent me a link to a job fair. I have a feeling I will probably get into an argument with my Dad in a few days or weeks about looking for work. But now I am afraid that history will repeat itself with me. I just feel no escape, and ideation to me is turning into something more, and I feel the need to end my life.",1615367009

Toxic mother, self-hatred, academic stress...I don't know what to do anymore.",2,m1rmmg,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1rmmg/god_im_so_tired_toxic_mother_selfhatred_academic/,0,"Long story short, I've been experiencing depression since August from December until now, it's completely plummeted.  My relationship with my mom is not great.  Since I was a kid, she would often hit me as a form of ""love"" and the reason why I have such low self-confidence and self-esteem is that I didn't get a lot of emotional support from her.   We have a very difficult relationship and she'll get mad at me for the smallest things and blame me.  She treats my siblings differently, she has never hit them and is soft on them compared to me.  

The reason why my mental health started spiraling this summer was that since college is approaching, I have to narrow down a career and I have a passion for art.  However, my mom discourages me a lot and I understand where she's coming from, but it's gotten to the point where self-hatred has developed from it where I despise my artistic instincts.  I've had a lot of times where I would ask myself, ""Why couldn't you be the child she wanted that was into something useful like STEM?""  Over the past few months, my desire to pursue a creative career has only grown stronger with my hatred for wanting it.

I've been having a horrendous time in school.  My art teacher has been overworking us by giving loads of work.  I sleep at 3 am and wake up at 6 am just because I'm doing my art projects.  I fall asleep during my classes and can't keep up because I spend so much time on his class.  I held a meeting with him along with my peers to let him know that I feel burnt out and that I'm at my limit.  He has also kept saying, ""You're not working hard enough.""  At this time, I was definitely past my limit and thinking about suicide.  He basically said, ""Well no one's going to say 'Oh they killed themselves because of art'.  I'm not holding a gun to your head.""  He's had a student who committed suicide so I thought he would understand.  His coldness caused me to spiral and I had the worst panic attack I've ever had.  I was traumatized and realized I was trapped in this situation.  I told my parents about it.  They took his side and just said, ""It's just high school.   You don't have it bad.  You're being closed-minded and you're so prideful.  You're so full of yourself and everything you do.""  My hands actually used to be my favorite parts of my body because they allowed me to do my favorite thing: art.  But lately, I've grown to despise them since they've been causing me so much agony.  I'm starting to wish they weren't a part of my body.

Since then I've realized I'm truly alone.  There's no one I can go to.  My parents take the side of someone whose class is mentally breaking me and whenever express how I'm feeling, they dismiss it.  I've had two panic attacks in front of my mom.  During one of them, I told her how I felt about dying and she just got angry at me.  She called me selfish, conceited, and just started yelling and screaming at me.  The second panic attack she got mad at me for something really small and I accidentally broke, saying, ""What do you want from me?  I'm trying.""  This only compelled her to attack and scream at me even more.  She refused to stop when my sibling told her to and kept on berating me when I was hyperventilating.  I feel like I'm stuck in a prison I can't escape from.  

I don't want to self-harm but I feel the urges growing stronger.  Today when my mom started yelling again, I couldn't keep my eyes off of a bucket of knives.  I hate the thought of cutting but I need to do something to get rid of the energy.  I keep thinking about it and every day I think about suicide.  Right now I don't think I'm at that point but my mental state keeps growing worse and worse every day.  I'm constantly thinking, ""I want to die.  I'm so alone.  No one's here for me.""  Hell, I even think about my funeral from time to time and what people would even think.  If they would even care.  

I know people keep saying, ""It will get better"" but when?  I'm so tired.  I'm exhausted.  I'm so tired of pretending to be strong when I'm not.  I've been telling myself this entire time that it would get better but it's just been getting worse.",1615388167

I wanted to die since I was 6 when I used to cry every night because I realized that we all are going to die and I thought: so was the point of living? But I was always so afraid to do it, I don’t stand pain so I continue living and trying not to think much about it.

Then I “accomplished” certain things and I didn’t want to die because of how this would affect my parents bc I’m an only child and they are so proud of me. I feel guilty for not wanting to live, but everyday gets more difficult, maybe I’m weak, but I don’t understand the point of living bc I have no purpose or “goal” I want to achieve... I already had everything I wanted I think... so I would just like to die.

I had a girlfriend and she really was great, she supported me through alot and helped, we sadly didnt click as our needs werent met and i always felt down about the lack of effort she put in such as seeing eachother or making plans and affection but she was lovely so the relationship was doomed really but the support i had was great and obviously i gave the same back. In october my dog passed away and really hit me hard it was because of cancer and she was only 9 bless her she was my best friend and i miss her so much, around this time i also got fired from my job, it wasnt a great job and i really didnt like it, the people there were all of indian backgrounds and took the mick out of me for being white and incredibly skinny but still a jobs a job and it was money, after these events mine and my mums relationship had really fallen apart and we argue all the time she starts on me and she has made me feel shit calling me things like a dissapointment which is a very hard hit to take from your own mum. Over the past few months most of my friends have all got girlfriends which is great but it also means they have alot less time to spend in the group also alot of their girlfriends are in my now exs group of friends and i do not wish to hang around with them because it makes me too upset and awkward so right now i am feeling quite alone as most of my friends are doing their own thing which is fine but i miss them constantly being around, Then 2 weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me and she was everything to me, my first girlfriend and it was someone who i thought cared and loved me so much, and i definitely didnt think she would leave as suddenly as she did, i know our relationship was bumpy and needs werent met as i mentioned earlier but our actual personalities worked so well together and now she is also gone im feeling so alone like all the effort and time i put into being with her is just gone and wasted like nothing i do will be enough for anyone. Ive had suicidal thoughts recently because my life seems to just be crumbling and its getting worse at a fast rate loosing my job, dog, girlfriend and my relationship with my mum in 5 months has been so shit and i feel done with life, my friends are still there and im afriad i will hurt them if i go but they seem to be ready to leave and do their own thing anyway especially with university coming up this year i feel like we will just part ways. I feel very silly at the moment but ive been slowly feeling more down the past few months and i want to reach out to new people ive never fully felt suicidal before but it is a reoccurring thought lately and im getting slowly more tempted to say fuck it and just give up as nothing is going well and i dont enjoy anything at the minute.",1615370529

They would mourn, but soon enough I would be forgotten. I hate myself so so so much that I imagine different and horrible ways to get myself killed. The only thing that keeps me around is cowardice and hopefulness for the future. As time goes on that hope started to dissipate.

It’s already difficult enough finding a job when you’re 18 with no experience. Not having a car just made it even harder to find work

I tried finding online work but I don’t even have any skills; and even if I did, I have no service because my parents pretty much stopped paying for it at this point. So Fiverr wasn’t going to work

I resorted to Craigslist. I posted an ad offering to be someone’s personal assistant

After getting a bunch of creepy emails from guys thinking I’m a female escort or asking for massages I reworded my ad saying I’m a guy and I’m not giving massages

That may have weeded out the creeps but it didn’t weed out the scammers

One guy offered to pay me $500 a day to manage funds for them. They wanted my banking information so obviously I stopped replying to them


Some responders had promising offers like $100 a day to post real estate ads for them and stuff like that

I probably should’ve seen that as a red flag because it was too generous

They either would only pay via direct deposit, ask for my SSN, or tell me I had to pay a fee that can’t be deducted from my pay, without even telling me what their company was or even who they were

I was on the verge of just giving up on Craigslist when the car was finally fixed. Things could finally get back on track for me

It took a while but I was finally able to start dashing all day daily. I started on March 1st and made $90 that day

I would spend it to better my experience dashing like getting a phone holder, some windshield cleaners, and getting an oil change because the car was in need of it. I loved every second of just driving around the city listening to my jams

March 2nd started promisingly. I made $42 and was even taking a break eating a sandwich from potbelly’s enjoying myself

Little did I know that day would quickly turn into the worst day of my life

I was on the highway in traffic. I quickly stopped in front of traffic but not too suddenly so I didn’t cause anyone to bump into me, anyone that drives probably knows that I’m talking about. I didn’t think much about it

But then 3-4 seconds later as I was peering at my phone checking the GPS to see which exit to take a car rammed into me from behind out of nowhere

Yep.. car accident.. totally needed that

Now normally in an accident like this the worst I’d be dealing with was just not having a car for a while but unfortunately since it wasn’t my car and I couldn’t get my parents to answer the phone by the time the police and tow trucks showed up, I couldn’t provide any insurance information

I was written a ticket for “Failure To Establish Financial Responsibility”.

The ticket was more money that I ever made dashing that week

I watched as the car was towed away with a completely totaled back. I was in possession of 2 MacBook pros and an Apple Watch, items I was delivering at the time

I had to spend $24 to take an Uber home.. and that’s that I guess

Now you’re probably going to say “Just tell the court you had insurance and you’ll be fine”

Well, the car never HAD insurance

Yep.. ever since last year when it was bought it never had insurance

That’s just wonderful.. now I’m going to have points on what was my clean driving record because no one could get insurance on the car

Some people would rather spend $750 a month investing in a business that isn’t even gonna go anywhere than spend $150 a month on car insurance so I can dash safely

That’s including me in the policy by the way.. if I was getting my own insurance I’d be spending over $400 a month and that’s with a clean record. I’m sure my rate has gone up now thanks to the ticket I got

Sigh.. Ever since that day I got a lawyer, I have no idea what will happen on my court date. Even though I wasn’t at fault during the accident I doubt I can backdate the insurance policy, especially all the way back to Last July. the ticket combined with the car rotting in storage plus just now getting insurance as well as even getting it towed back to our house ran us up over $1000. That’s before the insurance of the car that crashed into me even paid anything. We don’t even know if the car can be fixed

As for me I lost all my money, messed up my driving record, and I’m out of a job again. I’m not even going to bother with Craigslist. I’m not going to bother with anything

Every time something good happens something bad immediately happens afterwards to ruin my happiness. This accident didn’t make me afraid of driving. But it did make me afraid of trying to improve myself because life has proven time and time again that it will stop at nothing to make me miserable

When I’m miserable I make other people miserable. Who the hell wants to be around me? I can’t even keep a friend without cussing them out for leaving me on read after a week let alone get a job or get a girlfriend. Why do I even bother?

To be absolutely clear I don’t want to talk. I already said so much here my thumb hurts from all the typing. I don’t feel like venting, I don’t feel like opening up more than I already did. Don’t get in my pm saying “I want to be friends” because you don’t. You’re just an insecure loser wanting to feel important by approaching and talking to me like I’m a little kid

I’m killing myself. I know I’ve said it before but I’m genuinely going to do it this time. I can’t wait until I’m finally off this cruel and unfair planet

Well there’s my suicide rant. That’s it, I’m writing my will tomorrow before I die so I’m going to sleep now. Don’t wait up",1615382037

I want to give up,5,m1fcmx,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1fcmx/i_want_to_give_up/,16,"I'm so fucking sick of everything. I try and try so hard and I'm still at square one. Everything hurts and I'm sick of not being able to properly eat, sleep, shower, do schoolwork, anything. 

I was correctively raped for being trans. It was only recently that I could accept this reality because it hurts so much. I fucking hate myself, I hate being trans and I hate that no matter what I do I can't get rid of it. I wish my rapist could've genuinely fixed me. But instead I'm devastated and I feel broken from all the pain and I can't live a normal life at all. I feel so disgusted and ashamed for being me. I've tried so hard to foster self love but I can't love the part of me that caused me so much pain.

Don't ask if I can tell anyone because I can't. Even this feels risky. But I want another person out there to know. 

I don't want to live anymore. I want to die but I don't want to fail and I don't want to make anyone feel bad or feel responsible because nobody could prevent it if I was to do anything. If I knew I could die without upsetting my already distressed mother or scar my little brother more than he will be by a society that hates people like him I'd do it. Because there's just no hope for me is there. I'm doomed no matter what I do or how hard I try to think otherwise. I give up.",1615350148
"Curious about suicide, do I need to talk to someone?",2,m1lq75,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1lq75/curious_about_suicide_do_i_need_to_talk_to_someone/,1,"Disclaimer: I have absolutely no intention of committing suicide. I have no reason to believe I suffer from depression, in fact I’m generally a very happy person, both externally and internally. I have a great family, good job, I’m reasonably well off and I enjoy life. For that I’m grateful

However, I am EXTREMELY curious about suicide lately. And sometimes when I’m alone I drop everything and think about it for a while. Again, I have no intention of it, but I find myself thinking about how it would be, in a hypothetical scenario where I’m a different person who wants to do it. I was always curious, reading suicide news and stories in detail. Then I found myself researching assisted suicide clinics and (possibly illegal) websites selling stuff like pentobarbitals

These days, I now find myself planning a suicide step by step. The other day I was reading about a suicide when someone used a blanket. After reading it, I put my blanket around my neck to “feel it” (to be clear, blanket was in my hand, not hanging from anywhere). Then I started thinking about where I could hang the blanket, thinking pros and cons of various spots at house. Yesterday, I stopped what I was doing to go to the garage to stare at a staircase, thinking whether it would support my body

Do you have these random thoughts or maybe “urges” to think about suicide? Not only I want to live, I actually enjoy my life and I’m quite scared of death. But something makes me so curious about it, to the point of dropping everything and thinking about it for hours. And I’m a little scared that something might push me over the edge one day, although I can’t see what and how

Should I talk to someone? I don’t think a friend can help, because I’m not depressed so I don’t want someone to tell me “stop thinking about it you have a good life”

What should I do?",1615367971
"Scared I Might Be Suicidal, But Just Not..Sure?",4,m1gwwl,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1gwwl/scared_i_might_be_suicidal_but_just_notsure/,1,"I’m terrified to even post this, because posting this makes it real. But I just want some comfort of knowing maybe someone else has felt the same. 

I feel like I will not live to see the future. Like every photo someone takes of me will unknowingly be the last. Like when people make plans for meeting up a few weeks or months down the road, I instinctively feel that I will not be around to see it. Or I get thoughts of which photo my family will print for my funeral, or how they will talk about me once I’m gone. 

I fear that killing myself is inevitable. That things like medication and therapy can delay it but that someday it is looming in my future and I can’t escape it forever. One day I will lose the willpower to fight and it will happen. 

I am afraid of my own mind, and afraid that I won’t be able to control my decisions forever. And that once I just take the plunge and finally do it I won’t have to be afraid anymore. 

It all scares me so much. I don’t really want to die. I love my parents and my brother and my dog. I don’t even feel overwhelmed by any life events or trauma. There are things I want to do and goals I still want to achieve. 

I just feel like my brain has decided that I need to kill myself, and that every day is a constant battle of me trying to fight the inevitable. Please, if you’re out there and you’ve felt this way, please let me know I’m not alone. Please tell me there’s hope. I’m so afraid.",1615354333

I have bad depression and anxiety. This year has been he'll for me like many others. The reason that I'm posting on here is to get some in site and to let it out. I take so many different meds for everything and I always feel like shit l, I have bloody noses like 5 times a day, I feel so sick and I'm always tired. My mom is the one who gets the mess for me from the doctor because I need some like my ADHD ones and depression meds but then for every problem I have like not eating enough or not falling asleep she shoots me up with meds. I just got a dog and I feel better, she brings me joy and I was also happy to get her because then someone or something would need me and I wouldn't kill myself but this constant med indused shifty feeling has made me not take her for walks as much as I would like too. Now when my dog makes noise my mom freaks out and says how bad I am. She has now told me that if this keeps up I have to give away my dog, if this happens I'm going to end it. I take the train home and I think I will lay down in the track and end it. I try to talk to my mom about this but I always get yelled at and punished, last time I told her I don't want to take the sleeping meds she yelled at me about how I'm a lying and told me that if I don't take it then I have to go to bed two hours before I fall asleep. Right now I'm writing this on notes because I can have data or wifi forsome reason even if I'm just trying to help myself, I will pist this when I get to school where I can use there wifi.

Me inyecte aire en las venas,1,m1prtx,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1prtx/me_inyecte_aire_en_las_venas/,0,"Hoy probé inyectarme 60 mililitros de aire en las venas me tomo tres intentos tres chusones pero lo logré, me inyecte los 60 mililitros de aire en las venas sentí como viajaba e incluso escuché como creaba burbujas en mi brazo, me sentí más libre que nunca así que me acosté en la cama y cerré los ojos mientras esperaba ansioso mi muerte.

Se sintió 0 dolor a partir de ese momento la sensación fue extraña pero 0 dolorosa, se puede decir que lo único doloroso fue el pequeño chuson de la aguja, se sintió incluso relajante, senti que se me acababa el aire las pulsaciones de mi corazón se aceleraron y sentía como mi cuerpo quería deshacerse de el aire lo más pronto posible, empecé a tener una especie de eructos  pero no de aire saliendo de mi estómago sino de mis pulmones, exalava más aire del que inalaba.

 pasaban las canciones de la play list para ""sad people"" y cada segundo me preocupaba más y más al ver como mi corazón sequía latiendo y el aire era expulsado de mi sistema por los pulmones, no había llorado en lo absoluto asta ese momento, ese momento en el que me di cuenta de que, seguía vivo... 

Mientras lloraba y me traumatizada con la horrible sensación de estar vivo, empecé a sentir menos esas burbujas de aire en mi pecho, mi latido se normalisaba, volvía a respirar con fluidez y de tener esos eructos extraños y se acababan las canciones de la playlist, avía fallado.

Nunca me sentí peor como en ese momento mientras esperaba muerte y veía como está salía mal, solo repetía en mi cabeza ""no quiero que esto sea un intento"" maldita sea asta redacte una retro chimba de nota de suicidio super filosófica... En fin el resto de el día tube un muy leve dolor de cabeza, pero muy muy leve.

Si ubiera funcionado le hubiese dado un 1 de 10 en la escala de dolor, aún no se qué fue lo que fallo quizá tube que haber inyectado el aire más rápido, por que leí que la cantidad necesaria para que sea mortal de de mínimo 50 mililitros yo me puse 60 disque ""por si acaso"" pero nada eso es mi malparido cuerpo resistente que chimbada :((((

La próxima quizá lo intente con 120 (dos chusones porque mi jeringa es de 60 Max) y lo haré más rápido para que el aire no se disperse y se haga todo junto aunque, lo más posible, si eso no funciona pues toca investigar que otra sustancia legal o ilegal puede matarme sin dolor si me la inyectó.

I'm just not built for this body and I thrive off of awful emotion for myself. I thrive off of that sadness and I haven't felt that sadness in so long maybe I'll find it soon though and then maybe I'll find that peace and piece to myself.

I don't really know what's happening and I'm very confused but I'm hoping that if I die it will make sense again and I'm not always looking through this foggy mirror.

My problem (WARNING: death mentioned),3,m1hkgs,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1hkgs/my_problem_warning_death_mentioned/,1,"I made a post earlier quickly just to get myself into this subreddit. Here I'm gonna mention some things putting pressure on me and making me feel horrible.

To start, I never really knew what death looked like until I watched my grandfather whom I loved dearly die right in front of my eyes. He had Parkinson's disease for 13-14 years until it eventually took him out. It was pitiful and still scars me to this day when I think back to watching him lie in bed and wither away. A week later my grandmother on my dad's side had a massive stroke and was hospitalized. This was all within a week of each other in October of 2020. Later on, my grandmother passed away in November of 2020 exactly one month after my grandfather.

To bring you to present time, I am struggling with the deaths and personal stuff big time. I'm constantly being harassed and mocked by girls because I'm 6'2 and weigh around 245 lbs. Their words and the words of other people about my looks really hurt me. In the past week a girl I used to date about a year ago brought up false info saying I was harassing her and faked screenshots (I blocked her) and has had multiple people message me calling me names and shit. I'm to my breaking point. I think it's time I move on from Earth because my one friend I've always had doesn't talk to me much, and no one really cares for me.

Sorry this was a lot to read. I felt I needed it out.",1615356100
"I (17F) no longer want to associate with my older brother (18F). I know I’m doing the right thing, I just don’t know what I can do as of right now to take care of my family.",1,m1oshf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1oshf/i_17f_no_longer_want_to_associate_with_my_older/,5,"I and my brother used to get along up until a few months ago, we live in the same home and I just don’t feel comfortable. To clarify and not leave anything out, he has high functioning autism, he can work and do everyday things, but has a very hard time with comprehension and he tends to blow many things out of proportion. He has one friend who he’s known since middle school who is also autistic, so he rarely goes out unless it’s for work or to take a drive. We never really got into scary arguments or anything up until last year and I never really said anything about his autism, I accepted the way he understood and communicated things and left it at that.

Last year, we got into our first fight, he started yelling and arguing with my mom and she quickly tried shutting it down by ignoring it because with those kinds of outbursts, he just can’t let go of things and there’s no point in continue to try to convince him that he needs to calm down. The fight was over something small that was in no way my mom's fault, which in this case it had to do with him spilling something and it leaving a stain on his shirt. My mom tried compromising and telling him that it would be okay and that she’d clean it, but he just wouldn’t stop and he would start saying things like “you don’t even care” and it got worse from there. He ended up insulting my mom and that’s when she got fed up, she just stopped responding which made him so much angrier.

It started pissing me off and it would be my first time telling him to leave her alone and to just stop yelling. I know how much it freaks out my youngest sibling, who was 10 at the time. He just started going off on me and started calling me names and called me a “bitch” and a “whore”, I became extremely agitated and just started yelling at him back. I was struggling with depression and suicidal tendencies for a while and I had just been released from therapy 7 months before at that time, so I was still very impatient and sensitive. This is where it gets worse, he began to threaten me and say that he was going to hit me and to calm down before he did something worse, he did punch me and I hit back. We eventually stopped, but I felt extremely unsafe after that. My mom did eventually stop him and managed to convince him to leave and go on a drive.

This is all very hard for me to revisit so I’m just going to skip to the last time we have fought and spoken, this last time had to do with another similar reason and it was ten times worse, but I reacted the same. But with this final time, he started with grabbing his BB gun and saying he would either shoot himself or someone in the neighborhood, my mom and grandma managed to corner him in the garage and got him to hand over the BB gun. After this, towards the end of the day, he started “spying” on me and taking pictures of me in my room, I told my mom and locked my door. It made me uncomfortable and angry because when I told him to stop, he told me to “shut up bitch” in a very scary time. He then managed to unlock my door and threw water all over my floor with a large cup, I got extremely ticked off and went into his room and sprayed Febreze into it and that’s when he stopped laughing and immediately began to threaten me. 

He told me he would bash my head in with a hammer that he got from his college engineering class, he told me he would shoot me, and when my mom came to calm him down and get me to stop, he continued saying that if I didn’t stop, he would kill me. He ended up leaving again to go on a drive and when he came back, I could hear him talking to himself and saying things. His room is right next to mine, so you could easily hear things. He has this creation of an imaginary world and city, so he’d pretend to be a dictator of it, at first I thought he was talking about that, but he was just saying that he would “end” me and kill me with his BB gun. It freaked me out so bad, I remember just wanting to leave and wishing he never existed or at least didn’t have that kind of mindset.

He has a history of killing animals, at the old house, he’d catch lizards and dissect them, and he would kill birds and do the same. That’s pretty much why I was convinced that he’d do something to me.

Since that incident, I haven’t spoken to him, I don’t plan on doing so either. I plan on never speaking to him again and completely disassociating from him now and in the future. I’ve gotten closer to my youngest sibling because I want to be able to be that one sibling that he could feel at least some kind of reassurance from. My mom is an amazing parent, I don’t think it’s her fault that he acts this way and I understand her reasoning, she’s doing her best as a parent and a provider and I 100% believe that. 

I just want my youngest brother to be happy, it was a lot easier for me to grow up since I never had to directly deal with those outbursts since my oldest brother was younger at it was so much easier for my mom to calm him down. I can’t imagine what could be going through my youngest brothers head, I just don’t want him to have any depressive episodes in the future as I did as a result of what’s happened, I know it’s unrealistic to want him to always be happy, I know he’ll have his struggles, but I don’t ever want him to think about ending his life or hurting himself. I’m doing my best, I stopped talking to my older brother, I never plan on fixing our relationship, I know I’m young but I know what’s right for me. I haven't spoken to him in months and I feel so much better.

TL;DR
My (17F) oldest brother (19M) has been mentally abusive for a very long time and I’ve had enough, I no longer want to be associated with him and I just want to protect my family and have a better future.",1615377488

Lost youth...,3,m1hgnt,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1hgnt/lost_youth/,0,"Just want to share my story ,any input is appreciatet,even if you just read the story I appreciate you.Thanks.

Let's begin with the fact that I was born in first world country and have lovely parents and friends. City in which I born reminds of village type city,like there is no industrial big building and things like, but still there is a lot of going on - different events,competitions,parties,etc. Pretty much this city is really friendly for socializing,so there is always lot's of things going on. When I started going to elementary school I already got friends from kindergarten,they transitioned in the same class as I did,so from there I joined aswell in a musical school, where I met two guys who latter became my best friends,they were playing some flash crap game on the hall pc in the musical school and I joined them and from there I talked to them,they invited me latter in skype, to hang out with other three guys, who also became my best friends and we was like brothers to each other, we played games,went to parties,went out,etc.pretty much just spended all of our time with each other,it was really like brotherhood.But since we interacted so much I kinda was exhausted for some time and they were keep presuring me into going somewhere or do some things,so I closed from them and started to hang out with other friends of mine. At some point, around 13 years I've got exhausted from dealing with people completly, so on the summer break, I didn't hang out with anyone.After summer break my classmates started bullying me,cause I was kinda vivid video gamer and they thought that I wasted my summer for playing video games,but that wasn't primary reason. At that point i've got depressed and till age 15 was just depressed and didn't had any interaction with real human beings,instead I found virtual friends played games with them all day. At age 15 I tried to return to hanging out with real people,but I fall so far behind,I wasn't relevant,my experiences wasn't relevant, I was just so awkward since I didn't experience anything besides computer,in the last 1,5 year. After that I tried to socialize lots of times,but I wasn't relevant anymore,I tried to hangout with people,but I was just awkward. My old buddies also tried to help me,invited me to different things, but it didn't changed anything. I don't really blame it on bullying, as a kids they were just fucking around, I just took it too serious, although it's my fault,it's still sad,like I was a just kid,how the fuck do I know if they serious or not. So yeah now as Im 22 years old,I really hate that I didn't experience the youth, I hate that I lost all my friends,I hate that I lost all oportunities, I hate that the person I was - ambitious,fun,motivated,smart - died. Im just not the same anymore 8 years of depression,isolation and constant heartbreaks changed me, to the point where I can't be fixed. I'm just not the same anymore,compared to who I were,Im just a joke and the funniest thing is, that I can't do anything about it. As I said in beginning my home town is really small and since im now in College I live in with my parents still and so I live in my home town and whenever I encounter someone I used to know,it's just awkward,because I pretty much can't really say anything since I missed everything,I can't reffer to old good days,because I simply didn't have good old days. In terms of speaking with parents it's weird aswell since they had good childhoods, they always bring out something from their childhood or they friends come over and here's me,without good memories and no friends. I just don't know, I try to ignore that I don't have life,but I'm so tired of it,why can't I had/have good experiences like normal people and hangout with friends eating pizza,watching movie at fridays having fun,getting support,feeling that someone care about you,looking something forward to. No. My life is big pile of shit, take a walks alone by yourself,when everyone having fun,depression is normal state of my mind,no one ever cares about me,my parrents propably hate how big of a loser I'am and I can't blame them, I feel same about myself.I don't know how much more I can take it,I really dont,I feel so lonely,I don't care about anything at this point and existance is just a torture,if I don't have a good past, I can't have a good future,because I simply don't care about future at this point.Maybe I should get some meds,that will make me happy for no reason and I will be able to function as I used to,who knows?But still the friends part with normal people is unabtainablle,they are on completly different level.Maybe someone who had bad past aswell and can emphatize me and not judge my awkwardness and leave me since I'm boring,who knows.",1615355819

I have lost everything since the pandemic started and I feel that my anxiety and mental health have progressed so far that I absolutely struggle to even leave the house.  I know nothing about anything important and I can’t relate to anyone.  I have struggled with anxiety so strongly my entire life that I haven’t been able to muster the courage to engage in anything popular or fun.  My girlfriend is always out having fun with her friends but I stay home 24/7 and listen to the same 50 songs over and over and watch YouTube videos or play video games that I do not enjoy and barely shower or eat.  I stopped working out months back, I haven’t left the house during the day bar necessities in months, and my job is inconsistent and requires little effort with little pay. 

This all being said, I feel like I’ve come to a relatively definitive conclusion on what I want to do with my life.  However, I am experiencing immense anxiety about my death.  The sight of blood freaks me out beyond belief and the thought of being so lonely and so anxious in my final moments causes me so much panic, though I do see death as a way out.  

I’m not looking for advice.  I’ve heard it all.  “Oh why don’t you just go out more?”  Or “get involved with something that makes ME happy, because clearly everyone enjoys the same things!”  I know what other people think you should do when you say these things.  They will always encourage you to continue to live for your family or to go to therapy.  Trust me, I’m completely aware of these options.  

Essentially, I need someone to talk to regarding my peace and wellbeing.  What I don’t want, as I said, is advice.  I just need reassurance that whatever decision I make ultimately I will be okay and the anxiety and misery will subside.",1615341546

My friends are abroad and started families now, or they enjoy being with their parents. I love my parents but they are not enough for me, I need other people in my life than my direct family. I have failed to make new friends post university and while all my friends have now other groups of friends, I remain the only one that found no one.

You might think this is due to Corona but deep down I know I felt alone before this all started, this has just made me realise I failed my life. Despite putting lots of efforts into fitness this whole year and being the fittest I have ever been, I have no matches on none of the dating apps I created a profile on, despite decent pictures and bio reviewed 10000 times with everyone I know. 

I can’t bear to be this alone anymore, I don’t care if suicide is not the answer, I actually don’t have hope for me to feel better anymore. I have bought peanuts for the first time of my life and I look at them every evening. I don’t know why I don’t do it. I cry at random times throughout the day in between my work calls.

I have been to so many therapist but they always just tell me what I know: I know why I feel this way, I don’t want to change who I am and become someone who is happy by himself knowing I won’t start a family. I spent so much money to hear what I already know about how my own mind works. I came to believe therapy was for people who didn’t know themselves: I know who I am and how my mind works, I just failed at what was most important for me: not being alone. My deepest fear was to end up alone and I made it my reality.

Sorry for the long unstructured post, I am crying as I type this.",1615359316

Suicide Attempt (03.03.20),2,m1i8h5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1i8h5/suicide_attempt_030320/,1,"Last week, I hit my breaking point and attempted suicide by taking 100 20mg Prozac and 10 Xanax pills. I’m so exhausted of stress and living with a mental illness the past 4 years. I don’t have a reason to live. I used to think I’m the kind of person who says she doesn’t want to live but won’t ever have the guts to take her own life. Guess what. I became the person I thought I’ll never be. 

I took and counted the 110 pills at 1am (3Mar). Woke up around 4am to pee and fell down on my way back due to muscle rigidity (from all that fucking Prozac) and somehow managed to crawl back into bed and vomit a pile of white stuff out (must be the pills, it was white n pretty thick)

Next day, mom came in my room. Thought I was sleeping and left. I felt like if I didn’t drag myself out I would have really died in my room at the age of 22. Dragged myself out of my room and collapsed on the floor unconscious at around 10am and got sent to the ER, places on IV drip & given a couple Injections. They saved me unfortunately and a huge medical bill is coming my way. But my hospital stay was so recuperating, it was so peaceful and much needed time away from family, university and work. I had no stress during my 1 day stay there and the Nurses were so kind, and I enjoyed the bland yet healthy regular hospital meals.

Now I’m discharged with 8 day leave, but only to face the overwhelming burden of Uni, working and life and a mental disorder again. Fuck.

I don’t know which is better. Before or after. And now I’m left with Prozac withdrawal symptoms and have bad insomnia from that 110pills

Sigh and now I’m guilt ridden for making my mom sad and still being a failure at school, work and for not coping with my mental health.",1615357925

I don't think I can do it anymore,1,m1m8fy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1m8fy/i_dont_think_i_can_do_it_anymore/,9,"I've never really considered myself depressed or mentally ill enough to consider suicide. I've had moments where I've felt less than hopeful about my life and future but I never really felt any pressing urge to end my life. 

Ever since the pandemic started, though, everything's just gone tumbling downhill and problems that seemed bearable before are just too much to deal with now. I probably ought to provide context to make it easier to understand but basically I've had various health problems all my life, all of them related to my stomach in some way, and ever since I was old enough to remember I've always felt sick and have had trouble eating and trouble staying at a healthy weight. It's impacted my ability to make friends, work, have a social life, meet someone, etc. 

Since my earliest memories, I've always had horrible stomach pain, bloating, nausea, and have just generally felt very ill and fatigued for no real reason other than perhaps just not being able to eat enough. There have been times where it's been more tolerable and times where it's been worse but over the last few years it's just steadily gotten worse and since the past few months, I've barely been able to eat at all. Every time I eat I feel like I've ingested some kind of poison and sometimes lie awake for hours at night shaking and sweating and writhing in pain, and if I sleep I have horrible nightmares and wake up every hour or two to gag or dry heave. I've been on multiple medications on and off for far longer than they're intended to be used for, and have had almost no success with any dietary changes. 

I never remember a time in my life where I was able to eat a normal amount and variety of food and not suffer for it later, and I've never been able to hold down a full time job. It's taken me 10 years to complete my bachelor's degree because I kept on getting too sick to keep up with my classes and schoolwork. I've had multiple part time jobs over the years, some lasting longer than others, and I've never been able to be as hard working of an employee as I'd like to be because I've had to call out sick a lot and struggle just to have the energy to get through the day. I hate feeling useless, there's nothing more in the world that terrifies me more than not being able to work and keep busy, if I had to just lie around every day until I die that would be my ultimate worst nightmare. 

Needless to say, I've had a great deal of testing done to figure out what the source of my health problems are (I can expand on that if anyone cares to know, feel free to message me or ask in the comments,) and after seeing several different doctors, they've all come to the conclusion that I need to have my gallbladder removed. I had two tests done to check for gallbladder problems and both of them had bad results. I've spent many months agonizing over whether to have surgery and gave it a lot of thought, and try as I might, nothing I've done so far, no medication, diet change, lifestyle change, etc, has ever brought me enough relief to function properly. The problem lies in me always being afraid of accidentally doing something to worsen my own problems, as I have a tendency to assume everything that happens to me is my fault and whenever I'm sick or struggling, the first thing I do is try to find out what I might have done that might have caused it. Every medical professional I've seen has told me that removing my gallbladder should help me feel better and that I'll get gallstones if I don't get it removed but then somehow I got to browsing reddit and after reading all the horror stories of people who got their gallbladders removed only to feel worse and be able to function even less afterwards, I'm afraid there's no hope for me and that if I feel worse after the surgery it'll be my fault for not trying hard enough even though I can't think of anything else I can do. 

I'm sick and tired all the time and can't concentrate or focus and I'm always cold and shaky and weak and dizzy and every day I walk around all the time feeling like I'm gonna throw up if I hear the slightest loud noise or someone even looks at me the wrong way and even just thinking about putting food in my mouth terrifies me so much now that I get anxiety attacks when it's time to eat. I can't stand living like this anymore, I don't feel like I have any meaningful quality of life, and if I don't feel better after my surgery, I don't have it in me to go on living. I can't go on like this anymore, and I'm afraid the worst will happen and it'll be all my fault for not thinking to hunt down some super-specific thing I could have done to keep this from happening. I don't care about eating junk food or drinking or smoking-I've never done any of that stuff and I have no desire to, but I can't stand the thought of having to live the rest of my life terrified of every bite of food that enters my mouth or even just looking at or smelling food and not having the energy to do anything I want to do. 

I guess I'm just afraid there's no hope and that since nothing else has ever helped me that I'm stupid for thinking a surgery could help me and that maybe I should just end it all now anyways because clearly there's no hope for me. I don't actually want to die from an emotional point-there are so many things I wanted to do that I never got the chance to do, but I don't see any other way out of this if the surgery doesn't help me. 

Sorry if that was hard to read or understand, I haven't been feeling well and am probably not in the right frame of mind to string my thoughts together in a coherent way. I just had to get this out.",1615369534

No matter how much we try to love another we may experience difficulties if we do not love ourselves. To love ourselves is a precondition to loving others unconditionally. Otherwise, the person you wish to love will never be enough no matter how beautiful and loving they are. Love not only in words, but also in action and truth.

**Not Enough**

When all I have is you  
And you are not enough

Imprisoned by my thoughts  
Like thunder in my head

My hollow heart sinks deep  
On to the ocean bed

My tears make love once more  
To the navy blue floor

Dark as a sun free day  
Silent as the muted wind

Vacant as a cloudless sky  
Peaceful in deep sleep

When all I had was you  
But you were not enough",1615342059

I've been going through trauma therapy and after every session I get plastered and brand 3rd degree burns into my legs. It's been kind of rough. I had an appointment with my dr for something unrelated and she sees my burns and is like ""That's fucked up you should tell yer therapist."" but in a nice and doctorly way. 

So I do, yesterday I had an appointment with my therapist, social worker, and psychiatrist. My first appointment is with my therapist and I look like shit because I feel like shit. I tell him that I haven't eaten in a week, I've dropped 10 pounds in that time, I can't sleep, I'm anxious all the time, I'm self harming, you know that kinda thing. He looks angry and asks me ""Do you enjoy doing this? Do you like starving yourself and burning yourself. All of your problems are external, you aren't taking responsibility for your emotions."" 

All I can think of is yeah being raped is a pretty external problem. But fine I am not taking responsibility or whatever. I tell him I fucking hate myself. Then in his brilliant wisdom says ""That could be something we can talk about next session."" And fucking ends our hour long session after 30 fucking minutes. I have two more appointments afterwards but I decide to say fuck it and go home. I feel like nobody cares about me at this place, everyone I liked left and now I'm just coasting on bullshit. 

So I've been fucking miserable for a while because trauma therapy fucking sucks and hey look my cat developed diabetes, that can happen apparently, but Idk if it's helping because now he just sleeps all the time after I give him his recommended shots.

I just feel like everyone around me would be better off. I feel like a burden to my family and friends, and my kids deserve better than me.

Who will take care of my kids? My husband and I both work, when would I have the time?


It just feels like an endless bitter cycle and I can't really see the point. After first the only thing keeping me from doing it was my kids. I wanted to watch them grow up. I wanted to see them get married and start families if they wanted them. I didn't want to leave my babies. But now I just feel like a hindrance to them. I feel like the trauma I would cause them by being around would be more detrimental than growing up without a mom.


The only thing holding me back now is the fear of failure. What if I mess up? What if someone finds me before I finish the job? What would people think or say? What if I end up with brain damage and live? Maybe one of these days these fears won't hold me back.

I really don't want to live in the modern world and deal with everything, I'm going through every day drained.  I've told people how I feel so they're keeping an eye on me but that means I have to explain when I leave the house and stuff - I feel trapped.  I just want it to be over.  I've had suicidal thoughts everyday for a few weeks and made a half-assed attempt in mid February.  Just need a time and a place.",1615353456

No joke, It's literally killing me.

I'm so tired mentally and physically. I've never had this many suicidal thoughts until this school year. I just want to lay down and relax- just for once.

This is getting unbearable,9,m163mi,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m163mi/this_is_getting_unbearable/,2,"I have NPD.
I am being expelled from school.
I decided to stop eating and drinking as a suicide attempt.

Because of the fact that I thought I wouldn't be alive for long, I never thought about my approaching exams.

Yesterday was my first exam.

I was about 7 days in the process of starvation and 2 days of dehydration.
I was way too weak to go and give exams.


But I am still alive.
The school is obviously not going to accept my admission in the next class if I don't give exams.
At least that's what they're saying.

I've been shifted to my relative's place after my recent suicide attempt. 
But this is absolutely unbearable.

I'm too scared to answer the phone calls of my teacher.
If I'm getting expelled, how will that even matter?
Plus, she must've called my parents when I didn't pick up.
All she knows is that I'm sick and thus am not in the condition to give exams.

What worse can she do to me than kicking me out?

But the real pain are the relatives whose house I've been moved to.
They don't want me here. They know about my narcissistic tendencies. My aggression. My manipulative behaviour with certain people(my parents).

And I don't blame them. I would've thought the same about a person with NPD of I myself didn't have it.

They talk about me leaving when I go to the washroom, thinking I'm not able to hear them. They talk to each other about how much of a burden I am to them.
How my parents are useless. 

It hurts a billion times more when I think about that fact that these are the same people who badly controlled, manipulated, shamed and abused my mom when she  was pregnant with me. But they are the only ""relatives"" that live near us and honestly, my parents didn't have a choice.
They themselves are fed up of me.
So damn fed up that they had to send me to these people.
The people who didn't even let them live in peace.
The same people who blamed and bitched about my mother to my father and vice-versa.

The same people who wanted to break their marriage apart.

Just imagine how much of an absolute piece of crap you have to be to make your parents make that sort of decision.


The nice relatives I have live 600 km away.
I will be shifted back to my home sooner than I think.
They don't want me here.

Once I get back, I AM GOING TO END IT. 
once and for all.


Just 10 days. I've already starved myself a lot.
Dehydration for 10 more days will be enough.

It hurts, it hurts so bad just from holding all these emotions. It’s hard to even type them because I don’t know how to say them.. so please bare with me. I do apologize if no one gets it but.. it’s me debating on suicide..

Here I sit in my bed, someone beating on my bedroom door. The knocks feel like their shaking my body, they echo and ring so much? I feel like I’m on the edge of snapping. What I’ll do when I snap? I have no idea.. I just know I’ve been holding in everything. Everything. 
I’m crumbling man. I’m crumbling away like little grains. Shattering, falling apart, anything. I’m hurting.

Will I hurt the ones who hurt me everyday? Will I end this hurt? What will I do? I cannot say? I can feel my happiness becoming their hurt. Whenever they’re hurting I thrive, then I’m the happiest, even then. I’m hurting. I am never truly happy. I haven’t been truly happy in a very long time, I can’t even say I was happy then.. was it all an illusion? Do I just say I was once happy to have something to look for? I find myself sleeping in the dark anymore. Someone who used to be so terrified of the dark now finds the darkness their comfort. The way the darkness wraps it’s arms around me and pulls me into a tight hug.. it offers me.. comfort? I can cry in the darkness and it doesn’t mock me for being weak, I can self harm in the darkness and it won’t tell my secrets. It’ll hide those nasty scars and sadness in the darkness. My darkness hides everything, even me.. the real me. It calls my name everyday, asking when I’ll truly give my all to it. For it to only know the true me, no one else. What’ll happen when I engulf and accept this darkness to its fullest? Will I too become dark? Will I be able to hide myself like darkness once did. I say no one knows me but darkness knows me the best, they’ve been there since the beginning and I know they’ll be there to the very end.

Unrequited love,4,m1a45j,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1a45j/unrequited_love/,0,"For a moment, just a few weeks, I was on the verge of having it all.... All I would need to get by in life and be ok.  but self sabotage, procrastination and impulsivity has cost me almost everything.

My partner is close to leaving all together, no longer has intimate feelings for me and refuses to contribute much financially.  I broke her heart and never seemed satisfied for much of our time.  It was financial.  We met and I had a cheap little apartment in downtown Dallas and a very stable job where most of my co-workers were real friends.  She and I would take walks and chat about what we wanted to accomplish.  I thought she was ambitious and just didn't have anyone to help her.  So I did and took the risk and bought us a house and moved us away from my safe and affordable environment in Dallas.  I used to do double yoga sessions a couple of times a week and would go to yoga about 5 times per week.  She refused to pay for her membership, she basically refused to pay for much at all.  I haven't really done much yoga since we bought that house, not much at all.

I was unaware of how willing I was to pay all that stuff to keep her happy.  I didn't know that I would end up being so petty and resentful about money and now I have very little to show for all the time we have been together.

At one point in 2017 I was a highly paid Sales Engineer.  I took on that role to help us pay debt. We sold our house and the loan wasn't approved for enough money to re-coup all I had spent getting us to Seattle for the sales eng job. So we kinda broke even.  I was tired always, working a job I hated, loved the money, hated being in a competitive sales environment.  My director started mis-representing the numbers and sometimes I wouldn't find out until we were in a meeting with her superiors and the anxiety of having to cover for her was too much.  I couldn't cope.  My girlfriend loved me very much during that time. She fought to make me happy and I never seemed happy.  Always irritated.  My heart and soul is in landscaping, not IT.  Every time I try to landscape I fail. I fail hard.  I'm talented with it, but I don't have the relationships or facilities to do it.  I leaned on my partner to try and help where I needed it and now we don't get along very well.  She's still here, she still loves me, but the lack of intimacy is real.  My feelings of failure are real.  I have all this equipment and no time to use it.  Since she wont help with bills any longer, I cant walk away from IT and support myself on just landscaping money.

I pray to god all the time now.  I used to be agnostic.  I pray all the time that I will find like minded people that can help me make an impact on the world through my love of responsible landscaping.  Its important that I succeed at what I feel is my purpose. but im trapped and every day when I wake up all I think about is dying.

Why is it so freaking difficult to end self,1,m1jw5m,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m1jw5m/why_is_it_so_freaking_difficult_to_end_self/,1,"I’m so freaking frustrated. Every chemical suicide is impossible unless you are a chemist or really smart. All the things you used to be able to buy for detergent suicide are not available or not guaranteed to have the correct proportions. Drugs are too difficult because I’m not going to get raped in the process or arrested (I don’t know anyone that could help with a proper OD)

“Simple” attempts like rat poison or medication that’s assessable are not likely to kill you quick enough and you’ll just panic and end up calling for help or just damaging your organs. 

Trying to put together certain methods is TERRIFYING and so easy to mess up. Especially if you don’t live alone.

I just can’t believe I’ve spent this amount of hours trying to get enough info and I’m still here???!!!! Why am I such a chicken?! 

I’m sure if I told anyone that I would get the whole “what if you put that amount of effort into being alive?!!!” like it’s anything similar?!! 

I will always remember this documentary I watched  where someone lived in a right to die country and got permission to medically end it. She ended up not doing it because she had the comfort of knowing it was an option for her if things ever got to be too bad and had the support of loved ones. She wasn’t “terminally ill”, but she did have severe depression and ptsd I think. It’s upsetting because I can’t get support with this because everyone will FLIPPPPP OUT and I’ll get locked up. 

Therapy doesn’t magically change brain chemistry and people don’t realize that being happy and alive for some people can literally be like trying walk without legs. No one realized how hard I have tried to put myself together and help others and just six months ago I was encouraging people that life could get better and now it’s like my brain is dead. 

I’m just frustrated and feel like this has gone on for too long. I am losing my mind trying to act normal with everyone when really I’m trying to figure if dying is actually possible. I’m not trying to be a horrible and selfish person but I feel like my body can’t do it and I’m just stuck in a body that’s constantly panicking and can’t just settle and a life or if I don’t function horrible things are going to happen.

My whole life I thought it was manageable, and for the most part it was. Miserable, sure, but I thought it would be better than the embarrassment of admitting I have a problem and disappointing my parents. At this point, though, it’s too much. I’ve tried 6-7 attempts in the last year or so, and I’m constantly miserable, with not a day passing where I’m not plotting how to kill myself or thinking about how the world would look if I did or, even better, if I was never born. My parents aren’t aware of it and simply think that I’m wasting my potential on purpose, and that I don’t want to succeed, but I do.

No one in my family drinks or smokes let alone smokes up.  
I tried cigarettes for the first time in the seventh grade. Hash brownies in the eighth. My first drink in my freshman year of highschool and by the tenth grade I started smoking up. By the eleventh grade I began to smoke hash or hashish pretty regularly.  
I live in a city where most teenagers do these things and even my own best friends used to.  
But now out of that girl's group almost none of them do it and even I know I probably initiate it or do it the most. They all stop me and I do try to stop but I also can't help but forget about consequences and get carried away in the moment.  
My parents and siblings have found out several times and each time I cry and apologise. Everytime they end up trying to trust me again and I end up doing it again. Sometimes I try to genuinely stop and sometimes just trying to get them off my back. I used to do exceptionally well in school and everyone just assumed I'd make it big in life.  
They found out again yesterday after I came home drunk and high. I don't think they realised I was drunk but got me drug tested and it was positive. My father hasn't spoken to me since. My mother says I lack self control and discipline in all places in life and I know she's not wrong. I'm the youngest sibling. My sister who is nearly three years older than me has not spoken to me since either. My eldest sister and her child are due to visit at the end of the month and haven't made contact along with my brother who is already living in the US. My parents think if I move I will make my brother and three year older sister's lives miserable and stressed. They're not wrong. They think I'm going there for all the wrong reasons. I didn't think I was, I thought I'd suddenly clean up my act and get serious there because thats the vibe and atmosphere that my brother has created there. But again my dad is almost certainly not gonna budge. This has been an ongoing problem since the seventh or eighth grade.

Lately I've been failing in my first year in college. I started online in Jan and was supposed to move to the US in July. My parents no longer plan to let that happen. They also took my phone away. They're letting me continue college online for now but as soon as I am expected to be on campus they expect me to start college locally in my city.  
My mom told me I threw my future away w my own hands and my dad will absolutely not budge this time. I feel awful. They even took my phone away. I'm using a laptop rn. I don't like the idea of people in my small city knowing I got ""caught"" again. It's embarrassing. I don't know why they took my phone away. I'm not allowed outside my house right now. I feel depressed and lonely and keep contemplating suicide. If I've so royally fucked my life up then what's the point of living on anyways?

I really did try. I was supposed to do it in January on my 18th birthday but the stuff to do it didn't come in time. Maybe the universe wanted me to keep going or something I don't know.

But I give up.

I've already ruined my life. I have to repeat this year of uni. My parents would kill me if they found out. I've tried to drop out multiple times because it is killing me on the inside, but my parents said that they would rather disown me and kick me out of the house. I've already stopped trying, I haven't gone to a single class in weeks. They're all online anyways. No point in trying since I'd have to do it all again anyways. I have no talent, I don't even want to do anything. I don't even know what wanting something feels like anymore. I just feel nothingness all the time.

I feel guilty. My friends are such amazing people. Each and everyone of them. I know that it's not their fault that I don't feel any connection to them at all. My brain is incapable of that anymore. I feel so lonely all the time. I feel like I'm behind a glass wall just watching everyone else have fun living. I wish I knew what that feels like, I've never felt like a real person before. I don't think I'm fun to be around so maybe that's why I'm always ignored. I'm sorry. They'll get over my death soon enough. They won't even remember me. 

I don't have any value as a person. All I do is consume. Time, money, food, media, all of it. I'm not smart or creative or helpful or anything. I'm a waste of a human. I feel guilty for existing when someone much better than me could be in my place. I'm so angry but I can't express my emotions. I don't know how to. I can't paint or write or sing, I can't even be in a bad mood or I'll be punished for it.

First let me go over a few things I’m a gay male age 22 I have a long history of mental health problems but I’m at my worst right now. I grew up in a some would say picture perfect family but it’s not true my parents would argue on a nightly basis. It got so bad that if I hear people yelling or talking too loud I can have panic attacks because of it. School was complete hell for me only had maybe one or two friends at any given time didn’t help that I moved from school to school province to province in Canada. By the time I was in sixth grade i’ve been to 10 different schools. By the time I was in high school I was barely scraping by I was getting low 60s and all of my classes just enough to pass and get my diploma. I graduated in 2017 I still haven’t gone to post secondary or anything. I am currently working at a grocery store during the pandemic not my first choice but it was my only choice. I try to stay away from people so I opted to work nights so I’m only around people that I work with I’m not around the general public just nice peace of mind for my sake. But no matter what I do I can’t get the thought of ending my own life out of my head. It’s so bad that I started looking up different ways to kill yourself I looked up poisonous plants I looked up medications that I could get prescribed to stock up to it kill me. I have a notebook that I’ve been writing down grams of pills or poison serve plants that I would need to sufficiently kill me I’ve made a plan to park my car in the garage when my family isn’t home and start my car and just hope.I’ve been trying to Get a psychiatry appointment for the past six months and I keep getting told that I’m not at risk. That’s my provinces mental health care at work, Granted I’ve never talked about killing myself before in any therapy session I’ve ever had I always thought that I’d be too lazy all right give up right before right now I Think I might actually go through with it I don’t know why am writing this if I do kill myself it’s not like I’m gonna be able to let The people who read this now but if I don’t at least I’ll be able to say that I didn’t. Maybe it’s just deep down I know that talking about it helps but considering I don’t really have anyone in my life I can talk to about this it’s hard I have no friends even if I did I wouldn’t really be able to see them. Trying to find someone to date in the city I live in is like trying to find a diamond on the road. I can go on a dating app and talk to 50 guys and every single one of them in their 20s 30s would be saying I’m not ready for relationship I just want to fuck. Then there’s me the guy who wants to die but can’t bring himself to do it the guy who doesn’t want a relationship for the sex I wanna relationship so I can have someone to talk to someone who won’t hate me for the way that I feel or the way that I think. I don’t need anyone to reply or comments just need to talk about what I’m going through without being told that suck it up or get over it because that’s all my family does.

I am so done with everything,4,m17gmu,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m17gmu/i_am_so_done_with_everything/,0,"Hey guys, never thought I'd be on this subreddit yet here i am. I've been dealing with too much for too long. I hate the thought of suicide but sometimes i see it as my only option out of this hellhole. 

Where do i start, well i am a 17 year old guy who lives in norway but ethnicity is iraqi, parents ran away because of the iraq war and had me in norway. They've been horrible parents but i couldn't see it for the longest time. They physically, emotionally and mentally abused me. I have developed depression, anxiety and ptsd because of them.

I have 3 sibling, 2 are toddlers. I help them every way i can and am basically a third parent. It sucks, especially because i have to deal with my own stuff. Luckily I don't have too much homework.

I struggle at school. Ever since 6th grade. I was a model student and was used as a good example up to that point. I think that's when i developed adhd. I first started going to a therapist in 10th grade maybe and was done the next year. My therapist was nice at first but she refused to check me for adhd and i never got any medication for my depression or anxiety which were diagnosed.

My parents have done horrible things. They hit me several times throughout my life and they refuse to acknowledge them. Every time i tell them they either say i have no right to bring them up, that they have the right to hit me or that they had it much worse in iraq or that i would have had it worse with someone else's parents. My mom legit threw a frying pan at me and justified it by saying she knew i would've dodged it which i did. Whenever my dad tried to hit me and i defend myself or grab his hand so i don't get hit. They accuse me of hitting back

My mom has threatened to leave us on several occasions. Before i was even done with elementary school. They fucked me up. my dad once went into a blind rage and grabbed a long metal shoehorn we had and tried hitting me with it. I ran to my bed and hid under the blanket and he started swinging the thing at me while I was crying. Now i only cry during trauma and don't get to get my emotions out. I'm scared that i will not be able to cry if someone i care about dies.

My siblings have it fine. I'm the one who mainly gets the shit. Although, my brother who is almost 4 years old can't speak proper sentences and my nearly 2 year old sister can't speak at all. 

Since they can't read norwegian i am the one who had to do their stuff. Have y'all ever payed bills at 16? Cuz i have, and i still do. I have to read letters they get in the mail. I have to send messages to people. And so on. Every time i bring it up they undermine it saying i only write some stuff for them sometimes. I say I'm with my siblings all the time and they say I'm rarely with them. They undermine my achievements. They weren't even there for my middle school graduation (I'm not sure if that's only in norway or the rest of the world) 

They have stupid high expectations of me, they want me to get all straight A grades and become a doctor or an engineer or some shit. And I'm not that good. School is hard as it is, with adhd it's much worse. I'm in the process of getting medication and everytime I tell my dad I'm going to my neurologist he says ""oh yeah the doctor for crazy people"" they are very non-accepting of mental health. I legit think my parents have some stuff but they don't have anyone to diagnose them.

I am currently in an agreement with my teacher saying that of i can pass my exams and stuff i get to continue to 13th grade because i failed 11th grade. But if i don't I'll have to redo 11th grade all over again while all my classmates advance to 13th. I hate the thought of redoing years. 

My siblings can't communicate so we get some people over to out house to help them. I was recently informed that my sister needed to learn sign language because she can't speak. And my parents are making me teach her. Her sibling and not them, the parents

CPS has been over to our house several times and they've basically given me stockholm syndrome because i always tell them that they're great parents making cps thinking i was the asshole and was a spoiled brat. 

If i tell them they never do anything for me they say ""we buy you food, we buy you clothes, we buy you that computer and phone"" like doing the bare minimum is good parenting. 

I don't like the thought of brining CPS to our house again because i can't do that to my siblings. I care about them.

I'm planning on moving in with my girlfriend next year when I'm 18 and can own a house. She and our friend knows my situation.

I don't think my adhd medication Will come in time for my exams and i will probably will have to do 5 years in school.

But i don't know how long I can do this for. I've had to deal with this shit all my life. I don't want to commit suicide because i don't want to hurt my friends and girlfriend but i feel like that's my only current option. It hurts to live and i don't want to suffer.",1615328750

MAYBE its because thesis options are limited during this pandemic and I had my heart set on my university's state-of-the-art laboratories. 

MAYBE I'm just an asshole. I mean, is it still ""ADHD"" when my professor and the DEPARTMENT HEAD email me to nudge me into doing something I STILL didn't do anything. I don't know what I was thinking other than ""I don't wanna deal with this right now"" and so I didn't and here I am now

Today classmate just asked me ""hey are you enrolled in THESIS2?"" and I kinda spiralled down. My classmates are attending a 2nd thesis class while I somehow managed to not submit a thesis proposal and also fail like 3 subjects and endanger my scholarship.

Im just...tired. I regret not going through with the date. I asked for help, and it feels like it just ruined things more. My heart hurts so much from the absolute guilt of not feeling like I can satisfy everyone. I just want to set my family free again. They don't need to deal with me.

It all started snowballing after a physical fight with my dad. I’ve only been able to think of suicide for the past few days, it’s a new-ish fixation. The past few nights I’ve been in torment, just trying to get myself asleep. I keep having these crying spells that seem to come from nowhere; each time my parents will come upstairs to my room and try and comfort me, I can’t help but **act** like I’m better, just so they’ll leave. I had a panic attack about a week ago that sent me to ER, they hooked me up to an IV and gave me 10mg of Valium, it calmed me down but only made me feel even less real, if that even makes sense. I’ve had to take loads of Xanax over the past few days just to keep these panic attacks at bay, but all they do is take away the anxiety… …leaving me to nothing but my thoughts. I take Klonopin at night, to help me sleep, but I’ve yet to notice any effect. I just tumble in my bed for hours, and this causes an inferno of rage to suddenly appear. I’ve punched three holes in my wall in the past two days, I think I may have broken one of my fingers but I just can’t tell. I just took a 30 minute walk around my neighborhood (5:00AM) and couldn’t stop thinking about a car driving by and just ending me right there, but the thought was almost comforting. I’ve been thinking about suicide, but not the actual act of committing it. I’ve pondered ways in which I could do it, I could just hit a couple of buttons on my insulin pump and pass away via diabetic coma, it’d be painless and probably appear as a simple accident. I’ve been driving extremely recklessly lately too, I raced a Porsche and we got up to 130mph in a 40mph limit (that’s the only sense of fun I’ve had in the past month). While I’m driving I keep on thinking about how this next turn could be my death, but the thought doesn’t scare me at all. I’m starting Wellbutrin tomorrow, but I don’t think I can make it another two weeks like this. It just keeps getting worse everyday. I just don’t have a will to live. If I die, I die. If I don’t, I don’t. It doesn’t matter to me at the moment. I talked to one psychiatrist and he thought I might be Bipolar or Schizophrenic, all because I said “Yes”, after he asked if I ever have periods of being hyper (before, and after, I repeatedly told him I have severe ADHD, and that “I wouldn’t describe my hyperness to be comparable to Hypo/mania”). So he wanted me to get blood work done, to which I told him to have a good day. I’ve been stealing my dad’s liquor too, in hopes that it’ll put me asleep or make me feel happier, but I’ve yet to receive any results. I just feel hopeless, like nobody actually understands how bad I feel. I’ve been trying to get together with my friends, but they’ve been excluding me because of how much of a buzzkill I’ve been lately. I lay in bed for hours, just staring at the ceiling. I can’t stop lucid dreaming either, in those dreams I continually kill myself in every way that I can think of. I’ve got no reason to feel this way either, everything’s going right in my life. I got accepted into my university of choice, but that doesn’t even phase me anymore. Every day just feels like one long day, rinse-and-repeat.

The story of me,16,m0v9jq,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m0v9jq/the_story_of_me/,2,"Hello, I'm 23yo male.  


And here's my story.  


I lived in rural area from my birth. My mom was very stressed during her pregnancy and maybe that had influence to enormous stress levels I'm constaantly having. My grandmother had depression, but never did anything to help herself. Instead she was very toxic person, until death. That kind of person who shits in bed on purpose, when my family is changing her diapers, because she cannot get out of bed. My granfather was opposite, he was smiling very often. I don't know why he married his wife, but I guess life is strange. And my dad also lives here. I remember riding a bicycle together in my childhood. He was there, i could really say i had dad. Maybe not perfect, but he was. When I was 9 or so dad slowly became what he is today. A ghost dad. I don't even know how I'm supposed to feel about this. He is around all time, he has job, he is financially providing, he's smart, but... Maybe he's depressed and would do nothing about himself (like always, he even waited 2 years to see doctor because of back pain). But I don't know. He's not speaking very much, just casual phrases, like it's your co-worker who doesn't like to talk much. Maybe it's even harder that way. When a dad is always around, but his soul and happyness has gone more than ten years ago... I'd hate myself a bit writing this, maybe I feel wrong, but I could say my dad left me long time ago and I'm living with dad's illusion instead. He was a bit verbally abusing me (but that's very soft if I compare to other stories and he loved me, but he has his own issues he don't tries to solve) and wasn't trusting me (e.g. not letting use lawnmower, because i am not capable of cutting a grass perfectly or i would damage equipment) in my teenage years (10-17yo I guess) and I was sick of this and lost all interest in doing something and have very strong issues (low self worth, self blame, shaming myself and so on). I was blamed for lazyness, but that's what I did because on the one hand my parents tolerated that and on the other dad didn't trusted me. And also depression at age 15.  


Before I start talking about my depression period, I wanna talk a little bit more about my background. I said I lived in rural area. Rural areas in my country are infamous for alcoholism and home violence. It's far from Brasil or Russia, but pretty far from normal life either. So I had bullying and saw how every second person around is using alcohol every day. My family was like like black swan there, 'coz there was no violence and alcoholism. I was bit egoistic and to me smartness was perhaps most important thing in person. And all other kids in my village seemed dumb or naive (at least that was my pov then). So when I started going to school I began to isolate myself, as other kids were into bullying, alcohol or just didn't seemed interesting. Started with reading books. Lots of them. Later we got computer and video games and browsing slowly changed reading. I was very addicted to that form of escapeism and often got into verbal conflicts with parents. There was a bit of bullying in school until maybe 9th class. But it wasn't very strong, I guess all little things just got together at me.  


And now about first depression or how it started, to be exact. I felt in love with a girl. Girl of dreams, I could say. She was also from rural place, but she was smart, social and pretty. We started getting closer. We want to a cinema two times, but then something happened to. I don't remember exactly because I had really good memory and it has worsened since first depression. It makes me cry, but I cannot tell exactly how everything went wrong. All I remember enormous amount of stress, even shaking body, skipping school, parents angry and abusive at me because they didn't knew what depression is and called me lazy bastard, who is having teenager syndrome. Maybe there were some religion involved (I was very religious and became atheist largely because how religiousness negatively impacted my life). When I was in friendship with that girl, I also had some friendship with another. She wasn't that attractive or smart, but she was more initiative. So I had my first sex experiences with her. And it's very hard to admit it, but there were her brothers also, we would play hide 'n seek or mobile games in dark building, while I and girl secrectly touch each other. Our desire was stronger then, than people around us (about same age if u wanna know) who were also secrectly watching. I'm really ashamed to talk about this and I think I said enough. In short – my first sex experiences were pretty fucked up, maybe gave me some kind of trauma (though my psychologist says otherwise). Also that was second girl and I loved first more, so I felt guilty by doing this. And also when you mix stress and pleasure, pleasure starts looking like stress. That will explain many of my actions into the future.

&#x200B;

So, when my parents finally stopped shouting at me and forcefully getting me out of my bed by force and realised I might have depression, things started to change. I was admitted to psychiatric hospital. They diagnosed I have ""mild"" depression. Maybe there it was mild, but before getting there I would walk outside in winter and just stare into the sky for half an hour, until parents would came to call me back to inside. Sometimes my legs would just guide me. I'm thinking I would have jumped of a bridge or something, if they were one. And they diagnosed me ""mild"" depression. I spent a month in hospital. You know it's a place with round corners and no fork, no knives, just spoon. I still managed to find some glass piece. I searched things like this on purpose, so at the night I could quietly kill myself. But a happy thing happened. I threw that glass piece outside fense, so nobody could do what I planned to do. Also I should mention one more thing. When I was in hospital, my parents told everyone I was sick with a virus and that's very believable, because I had many health problems and spent many months in hospitals during my baby and child years. Still, my first girl somehow got info from my parents, that I'm actually here. And she wanted to visit me. But my fathers said that maybe it would be better if I stay here alone. And I agreed... That was one of the most dumb things I've done. I'm having too much empathy for people. And I still always justify my parents actions, like they didn't knew, they were stressed etc. Fucking Stockholm syndrome.  


There were one or two years left in school (I cannot remember correctly, I said my memory has gotten worse from that point). I was numb. Did barely minimum. Grades hit record lows and that was first times of many others when I had to beg people giving me second chances doing tasks, homeworks etc. I was lucky, that before my grades were very high and I was smart person (now just average, maybe even below), so momentum helped me to finish school. In last school year I also had depression, that time it could agree it was mild. Again, antidepressants and psychologists (back then nor I was open with them, nor they were good specialists). Failed one exam, because I couldn't concentrate that day - my thoughts were about her, how tf i failed and if I have second chance. No need to say, a depressed person isn't very attractive one. I spend year after school working and that year was better. I retook exam and passed it, so I could go to university. Also I finally forgot her (not at all, but to toleratable level), finally forgave myself.  


University was a whole new world for me. New city, beautiful people, beautiful places, stories, bars, everything... But I killed it. I started drinking. Slowly, then a lot. It was my way of coping with unsolved problems from the past. I also fell in love with other girl. She was even better: smart, hot, social, courageous, artistical... But I couldn't be myself and show her more attention. Inside I wanted. But also inside I said I'm not worth her. Things from the past overtook me. One after another. Started drinking even more. Was dropped of university after a year, because of missed deadlines and bad grades. But I lived in that city for a year more. Walked across all places in the nights. When I was crossing a bridge, my body was always shaking, because I wanted to jump off. Glad never done that. One time I had alcohol overdose and had near-death experience. I was really close to dying that time. That shocked me deep. How far more are you willing to go? I asked. Fuck this, I'm gonna change. I answered. At that time I finally found good psychologist. I'm still going to him today.  


So, after two years in my city, which I love, I decided to give a second try. I went to a lot shittier university in city, which I don't love. And it's still the same fucking story. I was close to dropping out. Somehow I managed things, but I feel no joy, no motivation, again missing deadlines. Online learning is also some kind of schizophrenia. I took online job for relative and I'm missing his deadlines for months now, because I'm too much depressed, too less motivated. I recently found out that my best friend thinks I'm gay and he loves me and I couldn't tell him truth (I mentioned before that I often do diffent from what I actually feel). It really kills me inside. Also, I tried to talk with that girl from the first university some months ago and it seems she doesn't feel anything back and sees me just as a friend. I think it may take me at least half a year to calm down. But time passes and I feel lack of love all the time (ghost father, I'm only child, quarantine, fake friends (because lying became my way of survival, but in the end it harms me a lot more, because I cannot be true myself and my friends often have different interests from my real ones)). I could even say that I'm some kind of virgin, though I had minimal experience, but it was nothing enjoyable. And life is grey-coloured for me. Not chasing my dreams, not finding courage, not able to find happyness.  


Conclusion or why I am writing this. .. This is short story of my life. Sadness plays part role in it. And lately I feel very suicidal. I cried a lot writing this and took long pauses to be able concentrate on writing this again. I feel there's no point in living a life without love, without reason and with constant lies to yourself and everyone around you. It's been years and I'm still in the same fucking place. Tried everything for a long time... nothing seems to work. I don't want to die, but it more and more looks like the most reasonable option. I appreciate any comments, but please don't give me basic tips, like try sports, eat healthier, you'll find girl of dreams one day etc. I already heard them thousand times and if they have worked for me, I wouldn't have written this book-chapter-long text, believe me.

My brain forgot everything about being bullied just to save me from those memories but sometimes I wish it didn't.

I'm not the same anymore. At first, I changed my name because I didn't want to be the same person anymore. I wanted to start over. And then I began to question my identity. I was no longer a cis-gendered woman, I became a person with no gender. And honestly, that saves me from thinking I'm still that girl from when I was younger. 

I hate my younger self so much that whenever I see pictures of her, I instantly get the impulse to burn them. I hate her. She's not me.

I know that I need to forgive her but she's not me. She doesn't deserve my forgiveness. She ruined me. She let me get bullied and she let me suffer in silence and lie to the ones I loved. 

I don't want to forgive her, and I worry that, even though my therapist is helping me, that I won't be able to forgive her. 

Because, to be completely honest,

 it feels like someone else lived seven years of the childhood that was supposed to be mine.",1615333022

The worst years were probably 8th and 9th grade, I was figuring out my sexuality while wanting to hurt and kill myself. This year I’m thinking more and more about killing myself but I can’t do it because it would make my parents sad. Talking about my parents, my relationship with them is shit because I’m afraid of telling them anything about myself. Don’t get me wrong they’re great but I know that it would hurt them to know what I’ve been feeling. Plus my father’s kinda homophobic so I prefer to stay away from them and not get too close in case they don’t accept me for my sexuality (or if I kill myself one day, it will hurt them less). My friends know that I have had bad thoughts before but they think I’m good now so I don’t want to tell them. Plus all this stress from graduating adds on the horrible feelings I’ve had.

Am I Bad For Not Wanting To Be A Caregiver Anymore?,3,m12r7t,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m12r7t/am_i_bad_for_not_wanting_to_be_a_caregiver_anymore/,4,"For backstory, I am my full time mother's caregiver. She has COPD so requires constant care. Have been for about five years. I live with her, my little brother (mentally disabled basically a 5yo trapped in a man's body) and my stepfather. I don't work due to my mom needing me so I have no real income. We moved to our current house at the atart of Covid. It's much smaller than the last one and it seems like my duties have become much more difficult. Before my stepdad helped out quite a bit and it wasn't so bad. I used to be able to go into my room and have alone time. I don't have that anymore. Yes I have a room here but it's tiny and right next to her's. It's but an adjoining bathroom away. 

She calls me to do stuff for her every five minutes I swear. I rarely get a reprieve. It's always something. Getting her treatments, handing her cigarettes. Picking up tissue all over the floor. That one is constant. She's gotten more paranoid over the years and now refuses to touch anything without a tissue. There is a trashcan right next to her bed but she just basically tosses it and let's it land wherever. I bring her food and water from the mini fridge in her room. I do pretty much everything. I apply bandaids constantly bc her medication makes her itch and she has a penchant for picking at her scabs. I feel like she is capable of doing certain things for herself but refuses to. I mean, she calls me to fetch things within her reach. Literally six inches away and I have to hand it to her. 

She takes pain medication but often runs out bc she takes more than she should. That's when she gets very well not nice. I get that she's in pain but I hate when she runs out of medication bc she says the meanest things. She often makes me cry. I'm a very sensitive person. The other day was one of those days. All day long she yelled at me. First it was bc I woke up to her yelling at my stepdad. I went to check on her and said I was going to go back to sleep. She yelled at me bc I couldn't tell her how long I'd be asleep. Later I came back in to see if she needed anything mentioning that I couldn't go back to sleep. I was waiting for her to respond and she called me stupid for ""just standing there"". She called me to fetch something for her a bit later and then yelled at me to leave her alone so I left. Then she yelled at me for ""sighing too hard"". I'll admit I was frustrated. Then she yelled at me for ""making the paper touch her arm"" as I was handing her her lunch. Yelled at me for my swester touching her bed. Later she called for me to open her tissue boxes. I accidentally gave myself a deep paper cut from the cardboard. It started to bleed so I put a bandaid on. She yelled at me for that too! She said it was my fault that she wouldn't be eating for the rest of the day. She didn't want me touching anything because of the bandaid. She was worried I'd contaminate her food. I said my stepdad could step in but she refused as she was still mad at him from earlier. Then she yelled bc I was ""trying to make it her fault"" that I gave myself a paper cut and that it wouldn't have happened if I'd just opened it slowly like I usually do. The problem was I was trying to do it fast bc she had been yelling at me constantly. I was just trying to get it done. 

I think that was the breaking point. It's just so hard doing all these things for her. This past year has been hell. We moved back to my hometown where I was bullied all through middle school and high school. It's a small town with the closest stores half an hour away. I never leave the house. She's so paranoid about Covid that I can't even go to the library anymore like I used to. No more lunches with my other brother. I don't get to see my nieces anymore either. It's just me and her all the time. It's gotten to the point where I don't like being alive anymore. My old self harm and suicidal thoughts have come back. I just feel so trapped like there's no way out. I can't move out bc again no income. And if I did I'd just be the shitty daughter who abandoned her sick mother. 

Don't get me wrong. I love my mom. I acknowledge that she has done a lot for me like letting me live with her and buying me necessities and such. But I have done a lot too! I feel like she doesn't acknowledge all the work I do. It's hard and exhausting. And yea I am sick of it. I HATE it. I don't want to do it anymore. I keep begging my parents to relocate so at least I'm out of this wretched town but it's not working. I have given up so much for her and she won't do this one thing for me. Stimulus is coming and they would have the money to leave but they won't. 

Even before this house I sacrificed a lot. I stopped dating bc she wanted me too. The thought of me having sex makes her uncomfortable evidently. I mention that I'm lonely but she says I have her so I shouldn't be. I stopped going out. No more restaurants or movies. She never did like me going places with my brother. She doesn't trust his driving she says. I couldn't even go for a walk. She is afraid that someone will kidnap me if I go anywhere alone. I've given up wearing perfume bc she claims it gets to her breathing. She doesn't like that I use scented shampoo even. I've even given up dying my hair and wearing nail polish. I've done all these things so I just don't understand why she treats me so horribly sometimes. I guess my question is am I expecting too much? Am I bad for wanting to leave and never look back? 

Sidenote: I'm an aspiring writer and have been putting off publishing my novel(s) bc I'm afraid of how she'll react once I have enough money to leave. I know my mother and I know she'd want most of that money as payment for living with her for all these years. I'd be just right back to where I am. Trapped and alone. Most of my stuff is in storage and I fear that she'll destroy my prized collection of books or refuse to give me the storage room key if I don't do exactly what she wants. I'm just stuck.

After this Friday, it's gonna be Spring Break. Grades are gonna be finalized for the 3rd quarter. Currently I have 4 out of 6 Fs in my class because I don't have the motivation to turn in assignments. My mom knows this, my math teacher (who I have the worst grade in) told her.

I used to be so good in the first semester, I don't know what the fuck happened.

I've been staying up since 4AM just to get my work done but usually I just slack off and DM my friends how I feel (they're probably pissed off)

My parents know about my thoughts. A few weeks ago I went to a yearly check-up and I was given a mental health sheet to fill out. When I got to the suicidal/self-harm thoughts, I put a 1 (one or twice in the past 2 weeks, but it has now gone downhill from that day). The doctor saw this and told my dad. I believe my dad told my mom, but for some reason, I wanted to make sure so I told him if she knows.

When I woke up this morning, my mom told me dad is worried about me (we experienced a death in our extended family a week ago so she's not in the best mood). She said I don't have to complete every assignment, but I feel like I still have to. If I don't raise my grades high enough, she's going to take away everything I love from me. I can't really feel safe about my school stuff with mom. I remember a few weeks ago she asked why I wasn't completing assignments and I said ""I don't feel like doing anything. I'm unmotivated.""
And she fucking said ""If you don't feel motivated, remember that if YOU don't get your work turned in, then *I* will get in trouble"".
What the hell? Okay, put pressure on me.
I sometimes try to drop hints that I'm not okay during class (I'm too afraid to email them about it). However, it's just stuff like ""Yeah, I haven't been doing so well for the past week"".

Anyway, I'm afraid of doing my late work because my teachers might think it's too late and not grade it.
And if by some miracle I manage to get it all done, I probably won't be that sane by the end of it. I know I have a full week off, but I'm still going to feel mentally broken.
The stress is too much for me at this point, I would kill myself right now if I wasn't such a pussy to do it and know what the afterlife feels like. I don't mind letting go of everything if I am not good enough. What ever she takes away is not going to fix me.",1615308640

Keeping her out was a cushion in case I ever kill myself. Ie, it would be easier, because telling her is a deterant. Crazy, I know.

She wanted to know my address today (pretty casually). She sent me gifts using my address before (I knew that she would never find the receipts again in an emergency), but she never upfront asked me so that she would know where I live ""instead of having to search my receipts.""

I didn't tell her while on the phone. I skirted around it. But I just texted her my address and told her to hold onto it. I'm not entirely sure why I changed my mind, and when I was doing it, it felt like I was doing something regrettable and stupid. I know it could save me, if she ever had a suspicion, but I hold onto every buffer I have usually.

I'm not actively suicidal and I'm not experiencing suicidal thoughts right now, but I know I'll be having suicidal depression in the long haul, so I still keep my buffers in place. I don't know why I do what I do. I'm not even sure I'm depressed, just self-pitying.

Edit: She responded saying that she's hold onto the address and said ""don't make me use it.""

Our rules are located in several locations depending on whether you're on mobile or desktop. They can be found in the **sidebar**, **community info**, and **about** sections of the sub. Be sure to check those out and to lurk through some posts, before throwing a post down and immediately stepping in some shit.

NEVER Disclose You Have a Drinking Problem to Coworkers Or Superiors!,375,m2bb3s,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/m2bb3s/never_disclose_you_have_a_drinking_problem_to/,100,"I like reading through your guys posts. As a former alcoholic, I can't help but resonate with some of the shenanigans you get up to because for a decade it was me. But sometimes I see you guys with some really, really shit ideas or advice. One of your posts referred to no-call/no-showing your job. An obviously shitty idea that I did at my last job not once but twice. Most of you were smart enough to say ""well whatever the fuck you do, don't tell your boss you were too drunk to go to work"" but a few of you? A few of you have drank away every last brain cell you have if you think that's a good idea.

Know hows come I know that? Because I tried coming clean to MY boss about it, and it was a dumb fucking ass idea.

My boss was ""cool."" He actually wasn't at all, in the end, but the type I thought I could be honest with. I was pretty open about being a drunken fuck up. I was also union which saved my ass those two times, but you can bet your ass every single time I called off it was floating around that I was just a drunk. Sick? Drunk. Shits? Drunk. Accidentally overslept? Drunk. Drunk? Well those times were fair. And I could never call off legitimately or not without a guilt trip they wouldn't (and didn't) give others.

If I felt like shit? Drank too much the day before whether 6hat was true or not. I couldn't just not feel right without a smirk and ""drink a little too much did you?""

One time I brought a thermos of tea to work. I NEVER, EVER, EVER drank on the job. Fucking EVER. Took two cold bottles of water outside since it was a hot day and dumped some into my tea to cool it down faster. Saw a coworker across from me - and mind you it was FUCKING HOT - and offered her a bottle. She declined. I got back from my break, see my boss, and he says ""jokingly"" ""what do you got in there?"" I just thought nothing of it and said ""tea."" Turns out this bitch went in there and told him I had offered her a ""clear liquid"" on break. Yeah, she's a dumb bitch, but had my alcoholism not been known, they probably would've just called her a dumb bitch and that been that. 

It was a fucking TERRIBLE idea to disclose that. My dumb ass did it for whatever reason, but seriously, what do you stand to gain from it? They're not going to let you just start having drunk days off. Nobody is going to tell you they're proud of you. You're not going to be exempt from random drug tests now. It's a dumb fucking ass thing to do, and you shouldn't do it. If you want help and need to tell someone, tell reddit. Tell a trusted family member or friend. A therapist. But not if they're a coworker. Because they're coworkers, and it can only go poorly for you.",1615445517

You guys want to hear my most alcoholic thought of the day?,38,m2adjt,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/m2adjt/you_guys_want_to_hear_my_most_alcoholic_thought/,42,"So in my town I'm on a rotation of 5 different liquor stores. I don't get liquor every day but I go often enough to these 5 stores that they all know me now. I'm such a regular they tell me about other regulars who I met in passing who have since died of liver disease. Sad but you get the picture. 

Anyway, I'm tired of hitting the same stores up so I was thinking that I'll actually go to the grocery store for my vodka this time. At least that way I can get some prepacked salads and frozen pizza cause I always get the drunchies. 

The problem, however, is that my grocery story only carries the fifth when I usually only get the pint. I've gotten the fifth once before but you can imagine what happens when an alcoholic starts drinking and can't stop. 

Cut to the alcoholic thought of the day:

Maybe I can buy the fifth, scrounge up an empty pint bottle which I know is somewhere in my recycling, and use one of those plastic funnels to pour out part of the fifth into the pint. And that will be my ration for the evening. 

Where does this type of creative thinking even come from? 

Fuck me.

the scam that ruined happy hour,27,m2aeco,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/m2aeco/the_scam_that_ruined_happy_hour/,8,"So it was the longest day ever, the thirst was terrible, the bar so close yet so far. The internet goes down there is a loud wailing and gnashing of teeth from all of the employees their reddit, facebook, and actual work is down. I calleth the AT&T from beyond the grave on my cell phone they inform me that the fiber is most definitely cut. A tech comes out and finds that the fiber is cut less than a Kilometer away. He says they will probably fix it in about 6 hours. So I tell my boss we should send everyone home, he says no but that I can leave. He also says he is going home. So I ask the AT&T tech if there is any reason for me to need to come back because I want to go to my bar and I don't leave until I can't walk. AT&T tech laughs and is like yeah your good bro. So fast forward 17 drinks and onto my second bar the one that is walking distance. The call comes a raspy evil voice from the other end says ""Salt Lake Shady we need you to come let the tech into the building to fix the fiber, I answer back with a profound slur ""That can't be AT&T Tech Danny the kid assured me that I would be safe at happy hour"". The sinister dispatcher responds ""Well if you don't want to leave the bar guess we will just have to come later on in the next business day"". So I panic I'm obviously too drunk to drive but the fiber line must be restored or I will have NO JOB! No JOB means homelessness or worse Sobriety! So I close my tab and figure I will just Uber to the site but there are no Ubers nearby fucking spring break.

 So I have to call in a favor from a past acquaintance from the bar. At the last minute I remember the card he gave me Jamal's car service. Jamal and me met years ago after his failed attempt to flee the US. He had a lot of kids with a woman from Singapore I think. He quickly decided he liked fucking all the bar girls more than having a family and fell behind on Child Support. He called his wife one day and was like ""I'm leaving bitch and I'm going to Singapore where I'm going to fuck everyone, you'll never get another dime of child support"". He was unable to leave though due to child support and was condemned to the life of an Uber driver. As it would turn out he wasn't even able to remain faithful to Uber and started handing out cards to rich people so they could cheat on their wife and he would be their driver. I wasn't rich but I gave Jamal a shot of fireball one time and a sleeve of girl scout cookies so he gave me his card. 

&#x200B;

Jamal picked up and took me to the office building he laughs and says ""Damn Salt you livin like Pdiddy with all that liquor all fucked up homie"". I'm trying to talk in simplistic short answers with the AT&T Guys so I don't slur it all. So I let him in and take him to the servers. He goes up to the demarcation point and says ""well its definitely down"". Then he calls someone else and asks if the situation has been fixed. So I ask him ""ssssssoooooo whaaaaaat dooooo youuuu neeed to fix need to fix"". This guy says ""I'm just here to make sure the light turns from red to green when the field team fixes it"".  My happy hour was ruined and I had to utilize my Jamal because this dude gets paid to watch a light turn from red to green. Guy was probably on an overtime scam.",1615443157

I've tried to kill myself in the past but at the same time, I shudder at the thought that noone would find me for months because noone really cares. I know it's true. and that's just grim.

I'm bipolar so I'm either 0 or 100. no inbetween. have tried several meds on/off for 6 years. they don't work. I was laying in bed for three weeks because my mood was 0. then suddenly (without any reason) switched to 100, found myself in a vodka bender, and finally broke down, weeping my heart out in the hands of my best friend. just because I'd missed human contact so much. and I realised how much more they care about me than I'd ever thought. 

I was riding on that high (and the vodka) for a few days. now it's unbearable for me to be alone again because I'm literally scared of it, I crave human contact even more than before because my friends gave me more love than I dared to hope for, and the intrusive thoughts are back. what if I'm gonna have to go three weeks without any human contact again? what if they were only pretending to care about me? I hate myself, why shouldn't they do the same?

sorry bout the rambling, I guess I just had to leave my thoughts somewhere. sipping on some wine alone at home to run away from the withdrawals of the vodka bender.

In my early twenties I started binge drinking on a daily basis (7-15 drinks per day).

I have basically been consuming 8-15 drinks per days since my early 20s. I’m in my early 30s now and drink the same amount per day, averaging 70-85 drinks per week. 

No one has a crystal ball, but how long can I reasonably expect to live at the current rate? I’ve known of people who died in their 30s and 40s from drinking, but I also have relatives who are severe alcoholics and are doing just fine in their mid 70s.

I'm glad that I got it out of my system but the harsh rejection that ensued made me fall deep into a deep psychological sinkhole and I can't seem to crawl back out of it.

After she rejected me by text, she did suggest that we should talk face to face (we still haven't seen each other face to face) but then at the last minute, she cancelled because she was ""too busy"". She then suggested another day which I declined as I didn't want to pressure her even more. I told her that if I see her randomly at work (she works from the office more than I do) that we'd get some coffee and then shortly talk about it and that's it.

That was about a week ago and I feel it's getting worse, combined with the already stressed out work conditions.

As someone who has fasted for a month a few times it literally gets easier the less u eat. Each prisoner spends a month on a level. So ok u might fast and get another month on a crappy level. If no one eats u then u either live or die of starvation and humans can live 2 or more months without food as long as there's water. I believe the record is over two.

A friend of mine texted me yesterday to hang out. She’s gorgeous, a FA, somehow has her shit together, an overall 10/10 person. I was already drunk, but after passing out for an hour I agreed to hanging out. She picked me up and we went to dinner and she bought my food and drinks, it was great. 

But then she tells me her friend wants to hang out. I have the liquid confidence, so I of course say fucking hell yeah what’s social anxiety. 

This is when things go downhill..... don’t get me wrong, her friend was also beautiful and amazing but boy is she chaotic. But I fucking love the chaos. Always have. 

We go on a 24 hour bender. I hardly remember it. But it was fun, I guess.

Finally got home earlier today. Smoke some weed and pass out. Now I’m awake, with $3 in my bank account, new job begging me to come back on Thursday, no weed, etc. 

I have one beer to last me through the night. Aka about 2 hours before I lose my shit. The hangover hasn’t even kicked in yet. How’s your night going? Distract me if you have the time please and thank you :-(",1615378655

26M

So, at the end of today I'll be 11 days sober. Although I've had this pain in my upper left side and hasn't gone away. I've looked into it a little and it seems like my only symptom. However on day 5 sober the pains got incredibly worse after eating, since then it hasn't been anywhere near as bad but I assumed it maybe would have begin to clear up a little by now.

Ive had this a few times before in the past after drinking where it would be uncomfortable to sleep on my left side but that hasn't been an issue this time. 

What's the chances it may have gone chronic? If not how long can I expect until it starts to heal a little if I manage to continue sobriety?",1615392956

Stay off Highway 1: killer curves and a detachable penis,24,m1cfgf,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/m1cfgf/stay_off_highway_1_killer_curves_and_a_detachable/,14,"For those who don't live in Northern California, you've probably still seen the iconic Highway 1 in a car commercial or a movie. It's miles upon miles of winding, coastal road, with panoramic views of dramatic, crashing surf and windswept, rugged beaches sculpted with towering rock formations. Really it's undeniably one of the most beautiful places on earth, and I've been all over. 

Drove up to the southern edge of Mendocino County for some R&R in an architectural gem of a house. The scenery was just immaculate, the kind of picture-perfect atmosphere that makes you feel lucky to be alive on this bitch of an earth. I saw a pod of whales from the window. The quality of the sunlight on the glowing green grass was so beautiful it almost hurt to look at--silhouetted against the silver ocean were a golden doe and her fawn, delicately picking their way over the dunes. 

Stayed for 3 days, and, true to CA form, didn't end up getting any writing done as I had planned. I merely drank. And drank, and drank, and drank. 14 bottles of champagne, to be exact, plus a few bottles of expensive red I had ordered online under the delusion that this was going to be some kind of special occasion, only to chug them down like they were any other rotgut swill. This is one of my signature moves--psychologically attempting to elevate my gutter drunk behavior by getting piss-ass wasted on delicious, and very costly, alcohol. 

Last night in these idyllic digs, after being wasted but essential holding it together for the previous 2 days, puked all over the floor and myself (narrowly missing the toilet, amazing work by me here), broke three glasses in the rental house leaving sole-destroying shards scattered about, destroyed a cast iron pan (and nearly the kitchen in the process) attempting to sear myself a steak and forgetting about it. 

Needless to say, after this mini-bender (3 days isn't so bad), I was hurting fucking badly. And I had to drive 3+ hours home. Dry-heaves, foamy yellow bile, shakes, extreme fear etc were all in the mix as I attempted to repair some of the damage I'd done to this breathtaking vacation house. I'd say my stomach was turning itself inside out approximately every 20 minutes at this point, and all I had to look forward to was a 3 hour drive back down the 1. My head, already utterly swimming, swam harder at the very idea. Those switchbacks. The vertigo-inducing views. Everything about this paradisiacal milieu that had appealed to me so much initially had flip-flopped, post-bender, through the looking glass into a nightmare I was not sure I'd be physically capable of escaping. I briefly considered trying to find another place to stay close by to rest and deal with WD, but remembered sorrowfully that I needed to get back home to work the following morning. 

So, with a heavy heart and an extremely light head, I packed my shit, got into my car, and started to drive. To say that this was a test of my endurance would be putting it lightly. I had one (luckily large) empty McDonalds soda cup in the cupholder, which I periodically paused to vomit bile into, which also got all over my hair and hands. Lacking a napkin, I simply wiped this sour-smelling liquid on my pants. When the dry heaves were too severe, I would pull over on one of Highway 1's conveniently located and very numerous ""scenic lookout"" points, which were populated with families picnicking with their ecstatic, bandana-wearing dogs, and children, enjoying the famous views of God's Country. 

This experience was so surreal as to be nearly psychedelic. The low point was being pulled over on the shoulder in Bodega Bay while the 90s alternative satellite radio station from the car, which I neglected to turn down as it was the only thing distracting me from total existential terror, played the song ""Detachable Penis."" 

It was like being in a screensaver. You know the one. Perfect, immaculate green hill. Bluest sky you've ever seen. A simulacrum of the very concept of contentment playing all around me.

Life In Prison - Part 5,54,m0v796,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/m0v796/life_in_prison_part_5/,18,"Hello all my fellow CA friends and all those who read my posts. I am sorry I have been away for a bit. There has just been a lot of things going on and my main concern lately has been for my parents. I appreciate all the support and the genuine interest you have in my stories. This group is my favorite of all of Reddit. 

My parents have been living at there house in North Carolina and they were actually received their first COVID shots. My main concern has always been my parents and I do everything in my power to make sure my parents are safe and I look after them. It is called ""role reversal"" and I will do everything I can to make sure my parents are well.

Anyway... One again I will be using pronouns and the word ""you"" to make for an easier read..... So with that in mind.... Here we go.

So, let's continue with prison life. It can get boring at times. Everyday is the same. The same walls, the same corrections officers, the same food, the same schedule, the same beds, the same trips to the yard.

You know, I have to be honest. When I was locked up.... As much as it sucks.... I could appreciate the structure and the typical day to day routine of prison. It was really the closest to a regular day of living. I think a about the days where I would wake up counting my pills, scheduling my sales of narcotics, talking phone call after phone call from my customers. My customers who were is desperate need of their next fix, those who wanted to buy large quantities of my products.

I know I talked about how I didn't care who was buying my pills as long as I got the cash. As I have become older.... I realize the damage I probably did to a lot of people. Sure, if they didn't get it from me, I am certain they would find it elsewhere

As I would lie in my prison bunk. I had a chance to think a lot about my past activities and really had an overwhelming since that what I had been doing was pretty stupid to be blunt.

Money has a weird way of overriding the whole moral issue.... Sure, I knew I was helping those in addition continue to go down that deep dark hole of no return.

So, back to prison. There is a lot of time to think, reflect and consider the ramifications of what cause me to be in prison. To be honest, I must admit that I was feeling so sorry for myself because I was locked up. In fact this feeling of responsibility always followed me the entire time I was I prison.

I didn't realize that there was no reason for me to feel sorry for myself. These days if I were to supply a person with drugs and they did... I would be held liable for providing that substance.

Living in a cell with these kind of thoughts is really trying experience. I do have a conscious and I would think about this alot. I talked a lot with other inmates about how I felt. It was absolutely amazing how many people were in the same type of situation. I don't know if they felt remorse or guilt, but it was nice to just be able to talk about it.

Now, I was still reading and writing letters for my boy T. I hope you remember who I am talking about. (Please read my previous post to learn about T). So, let me tell you about what happened simply by doing kind things for others.

The prison decided my new job was going to teach those who were illerate or had trouble writing. Now, let me point out.... I have a Bachelor’s Degree from a credited university..... Heck, I might as well tell you..... University of South Florida. Anyway, I was asked if nI would like to do this.... Not forced.

I was hesitant at first, but word spread and now I had a class I was to teach 2 days a week. My boy T was actually a great recruiter. I had about 12 people in my first class. Simply, we were going over the  body of a written letter, how it is supposed to be done and all the 3 (?) parts.

This went really well and after about 6 six months... I had guys (almost all) with the ability to write letters. The most powerful experience I witness was these guys were exchanging letter amongst themselves and they were so proud of there accomplishments. It was such a great feeling.

A bit more about T. I always used his knowledge and ""feelings"". Meaning if the block was uneasy or there was something about to go down. He looked out for me.... (I have written about this before). He had a sense of the attitude of the block and would tell me..... ""Hey, just stay in your call.... Things  aint right!"".

I really feel bad for a lot of guys who a locked up. It's funny, in prison we learn to take nothing for granted. Around Christmas there was a Christian group that would come I a kind of give a sermon to each block. They also gave out candy as a gift since they new we would not be receiving gifts.

I held on to mine. Because I wasn't a candy fiend and I new it eventually would become like jail house currency.

We did have a lot of good times in prison. Playing spades all night, trading war stories, smoking cigarettes (when. I was in smoking was allowed). We would talk about the first movies we were going to when we got out. We would spend hours and hours just in great conversation.

The parallel I would like to draw is that.... Outside of prison, everyone is buried in their electronic devices. I was I a restaurant the (mask on) and everywhere I looked couples sitting together both on their phones. It's too bad.... I loved the constant communication in prison between all of us inmates. We learned how to communicate, have fun with each other, help one another out, back each other up when there were problems with Co's.

Sometime I really miss the absence of technology when it came to those long days and nights. It seems like people really were relating to one other and truly care.

No with all the electronics.... I miss talking to others and just being real. It's funny, I never thought I would miss anything about prison. But, I guess things always change.

Hey, if you made it this far, thank you for reading. I always appreciate your guys and girls comments

Feel free to ask me anything. I will be happy to answer any questions.

Much love to all my CA Brothers and Sisters.

I know this is kind of short.... But more is coming soon.

so now i've gone back to drinking, but im being careful not to black out (so as to not cause cause another ruckus). I usually drink from around 10pm (when my parents go to bed) to 6 in the morning. I wake up at noon and am still drunk but im able to control myself so as to appear sober. i sometimes have a drink during the day as well, just to get a tiny edge off till my parents go to bed, but i usually feel sick and pass up on it. 

ive been doing this every day for a little over a month. my parents are clueless, they are both well off in their jobs and their own shit and i don't think they understand addiction or even considered that i might have a problem. i feel completely estranged from them. but fucking fuck. i'm in online school cuz of covid which is how im maintaining this lifestyle. keep pushing off my assignments and its weighing on me heavy. my mom gets stressed about my school. if only she knew how bad it was.

when i switched to online school i cut off ties with all my 'friends' and i dont know why really, i just thought they fucking sucked, and i live in suburban utah and everyone here is religious as shit, i couldn't get along with anyone in a meaningful way. i was always the nicest kid in school but now i'm a miserable asshole and a prick. idk if its lonelier now than it was then, but regardless its too late to go back and act like i didn't just tell them to fuck off. what a grand conclusion to my high school experience: alone, drunk and friendless, typing paragraphs of bullshit on the internet. what a circus!

anywhomst im going to run out of money soon and i won't be able to buy anymore. i don't think i'll have withdrawals but I honestly have no clue. last year i got tactile hallucinations and vomiting when my parents forced me to quit, but that was also after almost dying of alcohol poisoning and blacking out. i didnt knew about alcohol withdrawals at the time and im really thankful it wasn't as bad as i hear it can be.

i dunno how im gonna explain what happened to my money when my parents inevitably ask me, and by then i'll be so dry that telling them will be near impossible. until then i'll have a few more cold foamers and listen the fuck outta alex g.

now ive been to public aa, ive been to sessions with a theapist (court ordered) ive also been to small groups of NA (they didn't believe that all i was taking, i dont blame them.  ive done some sus shit).  i always felt like i was in denial because i never felt like i had an ""itch"" to drink.  for me its impulse.  i mean i think about it ill prepare for it. but its growing anxiety mixed with impulse to shut the fucking noises and power down. i drink for blackout and enjoy the ride.  enjoying feeling the numb brain.  ok enough about that.

i tell the doctor about anxiety, depression, no sleep, etc.  she wants to give me depression, anxiety and sleep pills.  i dont like pills.  think that saves me from my impulses putting me on the streets.  i might just he lying but my brain believes it so dont tell him.  she says well it sounds like your self medicating.. first time i heard that.. ""go on"", she says that if i want to find the root of it get assessed by a neurologist.  fucks she talking about i graduated college (i mean associates but shit its something).  Im not mentally disabled, cant be. def not pre drinking.  then she said something that i couldn't shake off, "" a person naturally creates coping mechanisms for mental disorders and they will work until they don't."" 

NOTE:i lurk here alot.  Many of you say the shit i did to cope, not necessarily the drinking.  but how you carry yourself to not show who you are.  but im *no psychologist.

 I think it was covid that broke it all down for me.  i mean, most and the worst of the issues drinking brought me were pre covid.  but mentally, yea, covid didn't let *me keep moving.  its like i was leaving a trail of shit and slowly got to stuck to keep pushing fprward.. so i used the stimulus (i had trumps one saved) shit on that..

I Ate 7 Hot Dogs in 3 Minutes,46,lzf82p,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lzf82p/i_ate_7_hot_dogs_in_3_minutes/,17,"I posted a few days ago about having a nightmare while going through mild withdrawals after a long bender. Thank you all for helping me through it. Your kind words really saved me that night. I am now successfully tapered and feelin' fine. 

Today I discovered a video I took on my phone in the middle of my blackout. This is nothing new... I tend to find about 19 or 20 random videos/selfies from each bender. 

This one was particularly hilarious though. I have video evidence that I ate SEVEN Schneider's all beef hot dogs in 2 minutes and 52 seconds. I sorta recall making a few hot dogs and eating them but damn, I don't remember going all Joey Chestnut on 'em! 

I've watched this video about 15 times now. It's uncanny. I barely eat anything during benders and I have no idea where the appetite came from. But I discovered a new skill, so that's very neat. 

Have a great Saturday night. Don't do anything that u/OppositeYouth wouldn't do!

Edit: I checked my YouTube history and realized I watched tons of competitive eating challenges the day of my hot dog binge. It's all making sense.",1615106239

A few days later he texted me he was gonna off himself.  I sure hope he didn't but that's not my business anymore.  I will say, though, he really helped me.  I've been in love with my best friend for years, but I'm seeing now he's not really much of a friend.  I went into the hospital for 103.5 fever related to all this, and he never even checked on me.  I know now how one-sided that all is.  I'm sick right now  but FREE.  I got reminded how awesome it is to be admired, touched exactly how you want, seen for what you are and WANTED.

i remember almost everything. then theres the dreaded blackout period i crave some days, just so i can stop existing for a while. not last night. i almost always have a couple memories of each blackout. its like im looking down a tunnel of black fog and seeing what im doing but i cant control it.

theyre like photos taken by someone else im looking at, with no context. one of the back window of a car from the inside. its lit up by the streetlight. another of his face. i think he was telling me to do something.

fucks sake. i know he was. 

why was i in the car with him? why did i leave the party and get into a car? why wasnt he talking to me when i was back at the party... hours later, sobering up. getting scared. i wanted to talk to him but he didnt look at me. did i do something wrong?

i know why but i feel sick i feel so sick. i feel so sick.

was i raped? its all ive been thinking about since i woke up. i couldnt consent to any of what happened. i feel sick. i was... i dont know.

i dont know if i need to take the pill. i know i fucking had his dick in my mouth. i remember it but i dont want to. in that photo in my mind. my throat hurts. i can smell his aftershave on me.

i didnt want to do any of that. i dont want to consider this rape. i just want to think it was me being a silly billy while drunk. oh my god. ive heard stories about this shit. those people were raped. the same thing happened to me. i cant take this.

i cant tell anyone. not anyone i know. i woke up at the house the party was at and he was there sleeping. i couldnt talk to him. my legs were shaking. 

i sent him a message asking what happened. maybe hes angry because i was too drunk to help him finish or something. i hope thats the case. i cant face buying the morning after pill.

hair of the dog but i dont have any alcohol. help me someone. i wont reply to dms but thank you if you say kind of even mean things fuck it. its too hard to open up one on one. here it feels like talking to the void but in a comforting way.

i know i couldnt consent because i was blackout drunk and stuck in his car but all i can do is pretend it didnt happen.

I’m unemployed because I couldn’t handle the physical pain in my leg and also because it’s fucking hard to work when you’re hungover as hell. 

I’m a late in life alcoholic so it feels like I have lived two separate lives. I never drank until after age 30. I’ve got two kids and a roof over my head so I guess I shouldn’t complain. I love my children but I fucking hate the monotony of parenthood. I don’t enjoy anything. I don’t like myself even. I know that I’m fucked but the only time I feel better is when I’m drunk. 

Tried meds. Tried therapy. Tried positive self talk. But reality bites. My husband is snoring his ass off in the other room as usual so I guess I won’t be sleeping again. I wish I had something better than vodka to numb the pain. 

The only thing that’s keeping me from slamming this pint is the fear that I’ll end up in the “behavioral health” ward of the ER again.

The night goes on, we play this game, can't even remember what it is, and I stop being a schmoozy shithead, just hang out with them. Jenny is really cool. I don't think anything will come of it, but I tried. I tell no one. 


Two weeks later (today) I get a call from a number I don't recognize. Don't answer. Then another. Then another. *Fuck off*, I think. Then a text. ""Hey it's Jenny. I've got vaccines for you and your wife if you can get here before we close."" OH SHIT that's right, I basically shouted my number at this poor woman and made sure she had it right in her phone. 


Having not told my wife about this at all, I text her, call her, can't even remember what she's out doing. She freaks since she is somewhat at-risk. We get the first dose, and I think I just got myself out of explaining at least 10-12 shitty bar tabs to her. She also does not bat an eye when I stop at the gas station on the way home for a rack and some goofy gas station drinks.

Would you please send me a letter? I would very much appreciate it. This is some great folks here. I have shared some hefty heartfelt things with some of ya. It is a really cool community.

No one needs to do this, I would just appreciate it very much. Handwritten letters are treasures anymore. PM me and I will PM you my address.

We continue with empty bottles and cans, the bins are always New Years Eve, and I have nothing to celebrate. There’s an ambulance chasing some poor soul in the background, and there’s nothing here. I can’t go on like this, but I’ve felt that way for ten years. I keep on. 

I always think I’ll do a happy post whenever I come here, but then I realise, there isn’t shit to say.

I still have to organize, do the dishes, sweep, mop, do laundry, hang up my clothes, etc. etc. etc. It never ends. I just sat back down cause it's all so overwhelming. 

This is gonna take a while. Let's see if I make it or just give up halfway through.

What I've Learned in 27 Years,99,lybttr,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lybttr/what_ive_learned_in_27_years/,47,"It is my birthday soon, I'll be 27 years old. Birthday's make me feel heavy. Growing older makes my chest hurt. It makes me feel lost. 

I feel as though, I was 14 years old yesterday but then I blinked and now I'm here. But here isn't so bad. 

I think my childhood was worse. I was very unloved. I never really felt heard. I always felt as though I was a burden. I still carry that energy with me everywhere. I am a childish person. I just want someone to love me. I scream often and loud with every fibre of my being for belonging. I never really feel at home.

I think alot of the love that I've experienced in my life has been conditional. Conditional of my sobriety, conditional of my successes (or lack there of). I think ""conditions"" hurt. I am trying to love myself infinitely as a result. It is difficult to look at the shittiest depths of your personality and say "" I love her."" But I try because sometimes I look in the mirror and I am 12 years old, and I needed to be loved so badly back then.

I am a difficult person to love. I  have trouble making friends and staying connected to other people. People hurt. Other people are a great source of my pain. I think that's why I prefer to be alone. I will always run from others before I am left. I can sense a slight change in peoples energies. It's a skill I acquired from my Mother. 

My Mother is a mystery to me. She may always be. But the older I get the more I understand her decisions. We are sick people. 

I am a sick person. However, I  am not as sick as I once was.

I try to do better every day, to be a better person than I was the day before. It is hard to be sick and self aware.  I was born sick, I think. I lived too long in the blood of my Mother.


I woke up every day this week and cried, like a baby I cry often. For the most part, I've taught myself to ""sit in it"", to sit in my pain and live there for awhile. I call it ""personal growth"". My Father calls it ""self indulging"". Maybe, it is. 

I love to indulge. That's not a secret. I have had many vices. I have tamed most of them. However, I still resist the temptation to burn myself to ground. 

I don't think that self destructive desire will ever really go away.",1614979732
"Quick question, been meaning to ask forever",13,lyovx6,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lyovx6/quick_question_been_meaning_to_ask_forever/,20,"Anyone else ever notice temperature spikes and fever when actively drinking, so not WDs? I don't know if I woud have noticed this if the pandemic hadn't taught me to be hypersensitive to whether I am feeling feverish (I work in healthcare), but many times over the past year I've been drinking my normal and felt sweaty so I've taken my temperature and it's higher than usual. Normally  like 99.6-100.4 farenheit range, so barely a  fever that I've noticed. Then it drops quickly, so I haven't worried about it

A few minutes ago I had a WTF? with it moment though. I got home from work, ate dinner along with my first drink, 5% 12 oz no big deal. After dinner I had my first double shot, white rum tonight, and settled down to play video games. Typical. After five minutes I decided to go to the bathroom, and while I'm sitting on the pot (not straining or anything unusual) I started to feel hot and sweaty so I figured I better take my temp. After I finish I pop the thermometer in, same one I always use. 104 point fucking 7. I'm like ""that can't be right"" because that would be a medical emergency in my book and I felt fine, just a little warm and sweaty. So I take it again. 99.6. I take it again 99.3. Again 99.2. Five minutes later, 98.3 and steady at a pretty normal temperature since. It's March, so my crappy  apartment with the shitty electric hotel heater  is habitually cold. I've got on jeans and a t shirt. I got fully vaccinated, moderna, a week ago. Most likely link is the rum, but I've only ever assocaited fever with WDs.

WTF? Is this a thing? I'm about to have some more rum, will report back. Maybe I'm allergic to this rum?",1615016194

Next day, my friend is telling me how she’s getting nice and buzzed, which made me remember the box of hard seltzer in the fridge that my roommate had. I’ll just have one, eh?

Okay well 3 days and 1 suicide attempt later here I am. Violently ill from mixing my meds and alcohol, at that! Even chose the alcohol over meds, I only had 3 left anyway. 

Boyfriend had to drive an hour after work to save my drunk ass from ending it all. He asked me if I had been drinking, I lied (for whatever fucking reason) and said no. As the empty cans of beer and seltzer lay in my room amongst the week old soup, neon purple vibrator,  and the pile of beer and bong soaked clothing. Lovely. He gets disappointed that I lie, and I do too.

Involuntary detox,15,lykf2i,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lykf2i/involuntary_detox/,11,"So this happened about 2-3 weeks ago. A bit of background, I’ve always been a binge/heavy drinker since I was ~18ish (currently 28M) but things really ramped up due to lockdowns and working from home to the point it was finishing a fifth everyday or two. I had sober breaks and went through withdrawals during sober periods before and they of course were always shitty but bearable. I’ve always been very high functioning and spread the drinking out through the day so somehow convinced myself I could just handle it like a Winston Churchill or Ernest Hemingway (I’m sure they’d be in this group if Reddit was around then).

Cut to 3 weeks ago which happened to be a long weekend, despite the lack of retained memories. I hit the Vegas water a little harder than I usually do and spent the better portion of 4 days drinking as much as as my body would allow while not really eat much, if any, food. 

I pass out Monday evening and awake around 2am with vengeful mix of tums, stomach acid and vodka attempting to make its way up my throat and out of my mouth. This ends up lasting the entire morning right up until I need to begin work, despite running out of inventory of things to vomit about 30 minutes into the ordeal. 

I attempted the tried and tested method of of getting a shot or two down enough to settle my stomach so I can get some Gatorade and toast in but I unfortunately couldn’t even keep a sip down. As the day went on, and I still lack the ability to keep a drop of anything down, including Pepto Bismol I realized this would become a problem. By the time the day was coming to the end the hangover was slowly transitioning into withdrawals.

I’ll spare the play by play but I was going through Dante’s Inferno the next few days, hoping that each layer of hell would bring me closer to the other side. Aside from the regular symptoms (tremors, sweating, insomnia, anxiety, vomiting, etc) I also had some weird symptoms I’ve never experienced before. For some reason the entire time I would always hear certain sections of songs looping in my head - at one point it was Enya and I’ll never be able to hear her music the same way again (I’m sure it will remind me of every tiny spec of l the inside of my toilet in which I had grown to memorize due to all the time my head spent there). 

Also, when I was attempting to sleep (which never occurred) I was having this half asleep phenomenon where I had these super short dreams that was reminiscent of flipping through the channels (think Rick and Morty interdimensional cable). They were extremely detailed and usually coupled with auditory hallucinations and the occasional feeling of being poked or touched. I also remember my heart beating so hard it made my vision slightly distort every time it beat which was as pleasant as it sounds.

This lasted up until Thursday afternoon at which point I hadn’t drank or eaten anything since Monday despite my best efforts and I knew it was time for a hospital trip which required to me felt like the equivalent of Sam Wise carrying Frodo to Mount Doom based on the amount of energy required. 

After lots of IVs, bloodwork, Valium and an overnight I was finally feeling slightly better. Turns out I had a small peptic ulcer caused by drinking that led to internal bleeding and lowered plasma count as well as something called Hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in blood that can lead to some nasty side effects) because I basically inhaled Tums like it was my job (to be fair I always threw them up shortly after so I didn’t think I was actually digesting them). 

Anyways, been staying away from the giggle juice since I got back home (aside from a mini bottle I found when cleaning) and I’m kinda glad it happened even though it was excruciating because I was feeling a little too invincible. I love drinking and it’s been pretty boring without it and I know I’ll ease back into it, hopefully with a new perspective moving forward.

There And B(l)ack(out) Again: A CA's Tale.,140,ly3ade,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ly3ade/there_and_blackout_again_a_cas_tale/,54,"Made it to 35 days sober before I caved! Started my new job last week which was revealed to be not quite the career opportunity the employment agency sold it to me as. Turns out ""an eye for detail"" and ""attitude of due diligence"" really just meant ""data entry monkey"". Still, I can't complain. Or, at least, I shouldn't. I was facing homelessness and would have taken anything. At least now I have an income and won't be shuffling out on to the streets again.

While the work was easy enough (if monotonous and repetitive), I was a little disappointed in the workforce. Everyone's friendly, but not *friend*ly. There isn't any workplace banter and no one really speaks to anyone else. It's quite a laid back office, but it's so quiet all you can hear is the *click, click, clack* of keyboards. That was something I'd braced myself for, a little. In my last job I went in sober, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, hoping to make friends and maybe have an *actual* social life above and beyond hanging out with other homeless people at the shelter I lived at. Fat fucking chance of that, as those shit heads were more cliquey than an all-girls high school. I tried to go in this time with an attitude of ""it's nice if it happens, but don't expect anything to happen"". 

The hardest thing for me has been trying to adjust to a ~~good~~ 'normal' sleeping pattern again. After over a year of sleeping and waking when I pleased, it was difficult to have set times for sleep and waking up, especially since I'm naturally a night owl and resented having to put myself to bed. I've only been getting 3-5 hours every night and feeling like a fucking zombie in the morning.

CA Ex got in touch. Some of you called it, and I owe you props for your prognostication skills. She sent me a single message on her birthday, midway through last month. Just a simple ""hello"". Guess she was lonely. I didn't respond and within a few days I'd even forgotten she even messaged me at all.

Imagine my surprise when I'm at work and I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket. I expect it to be a Facebook or Reddit comment. Instead it's a text from her. ""I just want you to know I miss you terribly."" What exactly am I supposed to say to that? I put it from my mind and try to soldier on for the rest of my shift. Didn't help that she then unblocked me on Facebook to send me a message with a similar sentiment. It was Friday and I considered having a drink to celebrate and now, perhaps, commiserate. In the end my laziness won out, and I ended up just going straight home after work, instead of trying to get some booze. Not that I really knew how I would get booze anyway, considering I had exactly no money. I thought maybe she was just drunk or something and acting out, but still didn't respond, much to my own surprise. 

Monday rolls around and I look forward to a new week and finally getting paid. I put my phone on my desk, fumbling around in my backpack for my headphones, so I can listen to some music, when my phone starts screaming with the Messenger call tone. I can see right away her name and face and scramble to hit the decline button. She calls two more times in as many minutes before I decide to text her ""I'm at work, I can't talk, not that we have anything to talk about anyway. Stop calling."" I immediately regretted telling her I had a job. That would imply I was still living in my apartment, and if she knows I'm still here she could show up whenever she wants - as I sometimes feared she would - and demand entry. She starts sending me weird, typo-filled messages; ""I love weeen mis you"", ""able to wish I could."" Right off the bat I should have known something was wrong because she didn't respond to me saying I was working. I would have expected her to say ""well done"" or ask where I'm working, or make a snarky comment about how I was unemployed last year but found a job within weeks of her leaving. Instead she just says ""good, call me."" What? I make her wait a while and tell her I don't want to call and that I'm moving on with my life as she did, when she says she ""doesn't have a life"" without me. O...k. I look at the calendar and it dawns on it's payday for her, so she's probably just hammered.

I'm all emotionally confused and starting to get a little angry. The woman who'd been training me since day one, and who was then sat next to me, dinged something was up with me, as she asked if I was upset. When I tried to make a joke about it and asked what gave her that idea she said ""you look *really* pissed off."" Snuck out for a cigarette and just tried to forget about the whole affair.

On the way home I decided to stop by the grocery store. I didn't really have food for work lunches and had been eating random shit like cans of chili beans or half a tub of cottage cheese for packed lunch. I figured I'd just grab some bread and lunch meat, something to tide me over before I got paid. As I was going around the grocery store I walked past their bargain/reduced shelf, which I almost always ignore because, as much as I love discounts, they never really have anything good there. I was so, *so*, wrong this time. Like a ray of sunlight shining down on Excalibur, my eyes fell upon a taped two-pack of lemon essence. Fuck, I forgot there's alcohol in that shit! Normally $18 or so, reduced to $5 because the packaging/box was damaged. Get the fuck in. I excitedly threw it in my basket and picked up a couple more bits with the last of my food stamps before I practically dashed home. It was only on the bus back that I realized while I'd bought bread for sandwiches...I forgot to buy lunch meat. Great.

I get back and make myself a few lemon extract/ginger ale mixes. The numb/tingly/slimy sensation of the lemon extract puts me in mind of fellating an anthropomorphic lemon, the flavor is so overwhelming. But I got nice and buzzed. Listened to some great music, played some games, had a real one-man party. It was only when I was halfway through the second extract that I realized it wasn't going to be enough to tide me over for the night. Shit. I decided to have another look around the house for any gabapentin CA Ex might have left behind. Figured I could chomp on that later to keep away the not-drunk-enough anger. I don't know why I bothered to look; I'd thoroughly ransacked the apartment multiple times over trying to find a bottle she'd forgotten about. But I *did* find something, in my quest, that was even better: a family-sized bottle of mouthwash under the bathroom sink that I'd somehow overlooked on my previous rummaging. Fuck. Yes. Ended up pouring myself ~~abominations~~ mixers of lemon extract, mouthwash, ginger ale, and cherry flavor sparkling water that she'd left behind. PARTY TI-

-I abruptly woke up the next morning with no recollection of having gone to bed. I momentarily panicked, thinking I'd slept through my alarm, like how I lost my last job, but when alarm 5 of 7 suddenly went off I felt so relieved. Mild hangover, but a couple of mugs of coffee, plus a mouthwash chaser, perked me right up. Tuesday was actually a pretty good day for me. Said hangover gradually disappeared within a few hours and I was left with this wonderful feeling of energy and contentment. I had a really productive day at work and it was smiles and jokes all round on my part. 

Then yesterday happened. Man, I don't know what it was, maybe just plain old hump day, but it was just *crap*. The work day usually goes quite quickly for me, but yesterday just *dragged*. I even heard a few people commenting on how long the day felt. Didn't help that, again, CA Ex was blowing up my phone with random, nonsensical messages and calls. Ended up getting home a little later, which put me in a foul mood. I already feel like I only get 2-3 hours to myself at night; getting home later made me feel like I had just enough time for dinner before I had to go to bed. On top of that I was juggling whether to have a shower then or in the morning. I decided it was probably better to have one then, as I frequently wake up later than I should and don't have enough time to take a shower and comfortably get to the bus stop without rushing. Plus, I needed some clean clothes, and the shower stall was packed with dirty clothes; I use it as an impromptu washing machine whenever I take a shower. Also didn't help that I reeked of crusty testicles, and I knew that if I missed having another shower in the morning I was probably going to make people at work throw up.

Procrastination struck and *have a shower now* became *have a shower in a bit* and then *might as well have one tomorrow, it's too late now*. I had more than half of that bottle of mouthwash left so decided to 'treat' myself. Ended up getting tanked and watching bits of *Event Horizon* and *Predator* again. I don't know why I do that; when I drink I re-watch the ""good parts"" from movies I've seen literally hundreds of times before. Randomly messaged another CA from here, hoping we could talk or something. I wasn't cognizant of what I was even writing. The hours went by and as it got to 1:30 in the morning I settled on the bold idea of just pulling an all-nighter and staying up through the morning and going straight to work. It was too late for me to sleep now. I was so drunk I knew I'd sleep through my alarms. Might as well have some fun and slow down the drinking so I'm not going into work completely blasted.

Woke up completely naked, spread eagled on top of the sheets. I don't know how or why I was naked. Although plenty of people sleep in the buff, it's not something I do; one of the holdovers from having been homeless is I feel *really* uncomfortable sleeping without pants/a t shirt. I once literally got out of bed to put my clothes back on after I fucked a girl in a hotel and we were both falling asleep. 'Undressed' for sleep, for me, is taking off my shoes and socks. I figured it was a repeat of Tuesday and I woke up early again so I just stretched in bed, wondering if I should work on that morning wood or not. Then I noticed the light coming in from the curtains and had an awful realization. *Why is it so bright outside? It's normally dark until I'm setting off for.....work*. Oh fuck, oh God, oh no. I jump out of bed and grab my phone, hoping - praying - I didn't sleep in. I look at the time: work starts in **eight minutes**. I overslept by more than an hour and a half. My blood runs cold and I feel the room spinning. Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid fuck. You blew yet another job you stupid, fucking, useless, drunk cunt. Numb with the horror, I start throwing clothes on. A not-me mental voice chuckles *Mr. ""I need to get up over an hour before I leave the house"" is suddenly capable of getting his ass ready in minutes*. Fuck you. *Get a Lyft*, I think, *with what money, dumbass?* Fuck. I need to call in. I'm too hungover/very likely drunk to sound convincing and the anxiety starts leaking. I see the bottle of mouthwash on the living room coffee table. Fuck it. I glug a few mouthfuls and distantly hear the Popeye power up tune.  

As my nerves settle I call in and give 'em the ol' razzle-dazzle: I stepped out of my apartment complex for a breakfast cigarette and the door locked behind me. I didn't have a key on me so I had to call the landlord to come down and let me in. Been using that one since England, even though I've never actually lived anywhere that was like that. Team leader tells me to just come in whenever I can. Decide to have a few more drinks to perk myself up. Even pour some in an empty soda bottle to bring into work with me. Maybe she was lying. Maybe I'm due for a firing. Work is so easy I've had major imposter syndrome. I blitz through so much paperwork I keep asking myself ""it can't be this easy, can it?"" and feel like I'm forgetting some kind of fundamental work process; that they'll sit me down and tell me I've set the company back days, if not weeks, for doing so much paperwork wrong, and that because I was late on my second week in my services are no longer required.

I quickly throw on what few clean clothes I have left. Shit does not feel right; it's hilariously too tight. I feel like my t shirt is cupping my pecs into man-tits and my jeans only go down to just above my ankles. Either I've grown taller and fatter in my sleep or the dryer at the launderette really is shrinking my clothes, maybe both. There's a tub of pasta salad on the kitchen counter. I have absolutely no recollection of making that the night before, but I'm grateful to my drunk self for having gone through the trouble of making it. I set off on a power walk to make the next bus so I'm not delayed by *yet another* hour to get into work. Right away I almost fall over from flaring pain. I've had this bizarre pain in my leg since at least October last year; I don't recall injuring myself, but it feels like I can't put weight on one of my legs before this flaring, electric pain shoots out, so I end up walking with a limp. If I'm in a hurry, it looks like I'm hopping. I'm thinking about all sorts of things as I'm walking to the bus stop but for some reason, I start thinking about this girl I fingered in a bar like over 10 years ago. She was...ok, I guess. Not hideous, but not exactly a stunner, not terrible in bed but hardly something to write home about either. Distinctly meh. Holds the rare distinction of being one of the few girls *I* dumped - usually it's the other way around. As if on cue I feel the blood start draining from my head and going down South. Groan. So now I'm hobbling up the road, like I'm doing the world's shittiest peg-leg impression, toting a not-so-hidden boner in my very tight skinny jeans. Fan-fucking-tastic start to my day.


I roll into work an hour late and my team leader barely even acknowledges my apology. That either means she really doesn't care, or she's not interested in my excuses and is waiting for the big boss to get out of a meeting so they can fire me together. I hobble over to my desk and sheepishly wish my team a good morning. I barely get a murmur out of them and the paranoia starts raging. The morning is fucking *awful*. I guess the hair of the dog mouthwash pushed me into being wasted again. I frequently forget what I'm doing and end up staring at my computer monitor a while. I think I even start mouth-breathing. I decide to save the remaining mouthwash in my bag for later, when the hangover kicks in, and get some coffee. Big mistake; I drink it like alcohol and just instantly fill up my mug after I quickly polish off one drink after another. 6 mugs later and my head is spinning. Decide to sneak out for a cigarette after lunch. Bigger mistake. Sudden nicotine infusion makes my head spin, so by early afternoon I feel drunk, dizzy, and pukey. At least CA Ex doesn't message me. I mull over staying late to make up for lost time, but quickly decide against it. I'll take the pay cut from a lost hour, I'd rather just go home and...I can't tell if it's go to sleep or drink more mouthwash. Team leaders usually leave on the dot at shift end, so I resolve to stay 5 minutes later and just lie on my timesheet and say I stayed a half hour.

Make your own booze!,24,ly1xwf,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ly1xwf/make_your_own_booze/,32,"So reading down the rabbit glory hole of CA, I noticed you fine fucks often have issues obtaining the sweet sweet nectar of the gods. So your old pal Snugglerwugs is here to help. Today I will teach you a surefire non expensive way to make your own. No more stealing, no more paying crazy prices. Granted I'm not going to teach you to still (its complicated, and can kill you if you do it wrong) however todays lesson is about making wine. 

Ok first off, the biggest problem is obtaining brewers yeast (or even better champagne yeast). That can be troublesome. Its usually sold at grocery stores in the baking isle so normies can make bread and shit. You can use bread if needed, I wouldn't suggest it because botulism. Use the internet. Don't bother with wine making kits, those are for suckers. 


Allright we need a cauldron to create our witches brew, glass is best but lets be real here, plastic is probably what we have. It will totally work, but it has to be clean. Use a simple soap with warm water, also wash your filthy hands.

Ok the fruits. You can use any fruit really, doesnt matter, dealers choice. Crush it up put into cauldron, do not add skins!(The dollar store sells cubed 1 gallon water jugs that work well) you can use juice but make sure its not high fructose corn syrup garbage. Real juice. If you can get you hands on it, add real honey beacuse, fuck yeah. The more sugar the better, you can also add sugar into it if you want. I remember a guy that would use a piece of sugar cane. Anywho, moving on. 

Fill the rest with warm water, Put your yeast into that bad mama jamma shake it the fuck up! Next you have to top it off. I would advise buying a cheap topper, Ive heard of people using condoms and balloons, never tried. You need to let the gas escape with out air getting into it, otherwise it will rot and turn into vinegar which is actually a great cleaner to wash away the smell of tabbaco off your walls and the shame off your disgusting genitals. 

Then you just wait for fermentation process to do its thing. 2-3 weeks or so. 

On a side note it is really easy. You can do it, I have faith in you. Just make sure your workspace is clean. If you fail at first use the vinegar you made to clean and to try try again, you got this. Also eat some fucking food.",1614940493

Freaked me out a bit, but could have just be severe dehydration. Nothing new there. I also remembered I had taken my vitamins like a good alcoholic the night before so I was thinking that maybe it was just all the extra that wasn’t absorbed passing through. That coupled with dehydration seemed to be sufficient conclusion for me.  This continued throughout the day even though I drank exclusively water and Gatorade

Carried on with life feeling like shit as usual, but starting to detox.  Popped the last .5 Ativan I had hoping it would get me through the night.  Woke up about 2 hours after going to sleep sweating my ass off and panicking like I do every night. But there was a new symptom. This itching feeling that overtook my entire body. There was no way to satisfy it. I hopped in the shower to see if it would help. Worked for about 10 minutes, then it became unimaginably worse. 

The next morning, I checked myself in the mirror before going to work and noticed my eyes were fucked. Not that normal cold, red, dead look. But I had gained some color....Yellow. 

Fuck. There’s no way my liver could be failing at 24. Then again, I was drinking well over a fifth a day.  Got myself to the ER, explained I was detoxing but I’m also showing symptoms of liver failure. That got me through and they put me in a room. I was pumped full of the usuals, went threw dozens of tests and was diagnosed with the dreaded “Alcohol-Induced Fatty Liver” disease. 

White-knuckled it from there. My symptoms resolved after about 4 months, but it was nasty. Eyes returned to normal, my pee was clear for the first time in years, and my enzymes dropped to healthy levels. Thankfully, a “complete recovery”.  But “you can never drink alcohol again”. 

Stayed clean for 6 months until I met a girl. Fell off hard and have been back in the throwes of CA ever since.

I woke up on Tuesday morning and noticed that my piss was brown. 

Guess what... the itching returned that night, and my eyes were yellow the next morning. Fuck. I kept drinking this time. I’ve given up on the idea of a “normal” life.  I woke up this morning to an email from my doctor stating that he received my calls and messages and that I need to enter detox immediately if I want to survive.

Anyway, the point of this story is that I’ve come to the end of the road again. If I don’t stop, I’ll probably die.

Maybe I’ll be back for round three here in a few months.

Unfortunately, my doctor disagrees, and refuses to prescribe me any anti depressants until I'm completely sober. He suggested seeing a psychiatrist and being prescribed naltrexone until I'm sober and then getting an anti depressant. 

Not to be a little bitch but hearing this kinda fucked me up because it just seems so difficult. Like, having to be sober for months to get a prescription to make me feel like a real person, then staying on it for months to see if it even works? 

I guess I'm trying to ask, are any of you guys on anti-depressants? Or have you been in the past? How does this shit work?

Anyway, as we alcoholics do, we would constantly talk about alcohol and share stories. He was the only other alcoholic I knew and although he couldn't help me, talking about it would be comforting sometimes.

We stopped talking because we just had way too different views and too strong of personalities and would bicker a lot. Not to mention he accidentally left me a buttdial voicemail of him on a date with a new woman. Which I went completely berserk on him over text. After that, he stopped talking to me. I've tried to reach out a couple of times since, but all I'm met with is radio silence and I can't say that I blame him.

Unfortunately work with my sister so she's noticed I'm not online and has expressed concern, I don't know what to say, I don't even know what I'm doing. I'll need to talk to her at some point, or she's gonna come over, and my flat is a crimson red flag stained with blood and bile. I was just starting to sort my life out, work was going well, had a payment plan for my debt, talking to a handsome lovely man and relationship may have been on the cards. Shocker, I'm fucking it. Man is aware of my CA/junkie past, dated me during, and was cautiously dating me 'clean'. I've never been clean, just maintaining. I never lied. But never told the truth either. 

When I'm doing bad it's easier to stay ""sober"". It's easier to hang on by my fingernails, the struggle motivates me, the pain keeps me going. The second I get an arm on the ledge, the urge to throw myself back down becomes overwhelming. I've broken an 8 month streak for self harming and feel gutted about that. Burned with a heated up butter knife so no risk of infection. I wish I could use this much detail with my therapist lol. Skipped my appointment yesterday.

This cycle is so draining. Since I was 13 it's been an endless washing machine of ruining my life with drink and drugs, drying up, and rebuilding.  Mid 20s now, I'm just tired. I feel terrible, I have a family who still care and want me to do well, I feel so awful about stressing them out, but I just can't seem to do life like everyone else does. My stint in rehab made me painfully aware of how my issues affect them (letters from home) and now every time I drink/use it feels like I'm punching bag them in the face. The second things start going well my brain goes haywire and I can't handle the thoughts so I pick up, I drink. Then I have a month or so of degeneracy before realising it's not fair to die, and it's not really what I want, and I start trying again. Haven't done any drugs so far this time, which, doesn't really feel like a positive. The gear definitely felt less hard on my body than the vodka does. 

I know what I need to do, I'm lucky I'm still employed in a pandemic, I have so much support around me, and I'm being an angsty piece of shit annoyed that I have to exist. 

Time for another vodka, maybe I'll have OJ instead of monster, caffeine isn't good for the anxiety. Chairs.",1614887556
A homeless man has been paying my bills and mostly everything else for about a year,501,lwydl0,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lwydl0/a_homeless_man_has_been_paying_my_bills_and/,92,"Last year, I lost my job due to my bipolar shitfuck brain, my shitty attitude/personality, and, of course, my crippling alcoholism. I’m a 33 year old woman who’s desperate to feel comfortable in my own skin and in society, but I somehow never really could. 

Maybe some will think « bitch just take your meds and stop drinking », and I agree, but it’s not that simple. I tried being sober for a couple of YEARS, strictly taking my meds and it was quite fine, but there was always a little something « off » that I have trouble explaining. So yes, I tried everything under the sun to feel normal and to contribute to society, but it’s way more complex than that. To the point where I just gave up. Anyway. 

What happened is that I ended up on welfare, barely able to pay my rent and surviving on the food my mom would provide me and a little pity money from my dad whenever he could. I tried to get a job, but with the covid, my mental health issues and my carelessness I basically just gave up. I cut ties with almost everyone because I just couldn’t deal with human interactions/judgement/pity anymore. 

With nothing left but free time, anxiety and despair, I started to go get my booze as soon as the liquor/grocery store opened (7 AM). Every single morning, there was this 30-something homeless man sitting next to the store with his little coffee/spare change cup. Every day I would give him some spare change and it made me happy to help. He was the only witness of my drinking downfall, and he didn’t give a fuck, no judgement, just a smile and a thank you every morning, and just that made me feel better in a way. 

Soon after, I was dead broke, choosing to spend the little cash I had left on the only thing that made me feel better, aka (cheap) alcohol. So one day, I didn’t have any spare change, and I asked this homeless dude if he wanted one of my beers instead. He said yes, and for some reason, I also asked him if he wanted to drink with me at my place. He said ok.

We got along really well, and he also have mental health issues (schizophrenia), so I felt freaking comfortable talking to him about my weird delusions and shit. I liked him and his presence so much I offered him to sleep at my place for a bit.

After about 2-3 weeks living with him, it was time for my welfare check, and I just assumed he was making all his money by begging and I couldn’t care less. It made me feel so comfortable to have someone living with me. He made me feel safe and I haven’t felt understood in the way he made me feel.

I just assumed he was making money by begging, but when welfare check day arrived, he told me he was deemed too mentally ill to work (he is), and that he was on welfare too. Little did I know, his welfare check is the equivalent of someone working full-time at minimum wage. His welfare check is literally DOUBLE of what I get, and with no hesitation he told me his money was for BOTH OF US. He literally gave me total control of our finances, cause he would blow it all up in a week or so in booze and dope. I’m not good at managing money either, but the trust he put in me baffled me, and I felt honored to be trusted that much. 

Then why was he living on the streets if he could afford a decent apartment? Because living alone triggers the worst hallucinations and fears, and living with roommates is impossible since he’s a little bit of a mess, clean-wise, which piss people off. I’m not the cleanest person also, so it was the least of my problems to clean up after him. I’m not a fucking filthy animal, I’m just not that much bothered by this. 

But most importantly, HE KEPT ME FROM DRINKING MYSELF TO DEATH. We’re both  drinkers, but it’s nowhere like it was when I was alone. I would drunk call people, get into fist fights, getting in trouble and embarrassing myself more times that I can ever recall. My drinking DRASTICALLY reduced since I was more busy enjoying his company, and I didn’t want to be an abusive ass-drunk like my mother. He deserves someone he can rely on, and I happily try my best to be this person. 

He’s seeing his doctor once a week, and we also have people checking on us on a regular basis to make sure we don’t lose touch with reality. They make sure we keep the apartment acceptably clean and they check our general wellness, physically and mentally. I wouldn’t have reached out for that kind of help if I was just by myself, and he makes me kind of accept my shitfuck bipolar disorder. I’m less ashamed of who I am, my limitations and it’s ok to get help for « trivial » things we have trouble dealing with.

We both have our respective illnesses to take care of, and unfortunately we don’t always do, but my confidence and quality of life improved drastically, and so did his. He makes me feel useful, understood and he listens to my crap and anger outbursts without trying to solve anything : he’s just...there. And same for me. We go through weird shit, weird irrational fears but at least we’re together. He makes me want to take care of myself not only for me, but also because I feel like he deserves what’s best. He is so kind, non judgemental, and he is so quiet and calm that I just can’t be angry around him or throw drunk-ass tantrums like I used to. 

What scares me is that at some point, I’ll probably have to go back into society, hold a job and all and I honestly don’t want to. I can’t handle the pressure of performance, I can’t handle being well-put and clean every day, and I’m always going to be « the weird girl », I will always have trouble communicating effectively, I’m probably never going to understand the « normal » and basic social rules, but for the moment, I am fine. 

I am, and will be, eternally grateful for this homeless dude who thinks I « rescued him » from the streets, but in reality it’s him who rescued me from my destructive self. 

I know it’s a long-ass post, and I don’t know if anyone will even read this, but I’m glad I got this out. *chairs*

Edit : I saw my psychiatrist yesterday (who works at the same hospital as his psychiatrist), and what’s in the works is that we’re going to have a meeting for the 4 of us. We’re open to go to rehab, we’re open to be closely supervised at home, we’re “comfortable” with our lifestyle but obviously we need to get clean and take our medication on a strict schedule...Our doctors are amazing, and they say there’s no point in separating us since being together is the best emotional support despite all this :) 

Thank you for you kind, human and heartfelt words ❤️ wish you all the best, fellow boozebags",1614818862

Basically I think I'm still functional but I want to know how much time I have before this phase is over.

Let me start off by saying that I've been reading stories on here and I have a lot of respect for anyone who's able to own up to the fact that a) their addiction is indeed crippling and b) there simply isn't good enough treatment out there at the moment and if you can be 'saved' by something like AA or its secular equivalent, you're one of the lucky few and probs not crippled to begin with. And I'd much rather hear from people who are going through this than from the NHS/AA robots.

I'm nearly 30, slightly overweight (since lockdown), always had a problem with binge drinking, blackouts, etc. It's \*very\* rare for me to day drink and very rare for me to not black out when drinking. I used to be able to take consecutive nights completely off the booze, and last year I was able to stay off for a month. 

With the whole lockdown situation, I've been able to live on my own so no one is here to judge me, and I'm working from home. It's a new job that I actually am desperate to keep, but I've gradually reached a point where I just quickly drink to blackout as soon as work is over (I'll have a vague memory of writing this in the morning but not much after that), then deal with the consequences (ie having to finish up work secretly while still feeling drunk in the morning, then gradually and painfully sobering up). In terms of amounts, I think I have anywhere between 25-30 units per night, normally in wine, whisky, and/or gin. It's never under 20 and never over 32, I'd say. That's been going on for the past year of lockdown. Before that it would have been the same amount on a single night but way more nights off in a month. I'm finding in increasingly difficult if not imposssible to take a night off.

I am one lucky motherfucker because I never experienced any severe symptoms of physical withdrawal in the past. I do have a tendency to piss myself after blacking out (not a regular thing but it has happened way more times than I'd have expected). I sometimes throw up - often in the mornings and very rarely straight after drinking. My throat and esopaghagus feel like dry parchment but on fire at the same time. I wouldn't say I'm in any physical pain, anywhere. I am still able to eat like a pig (I don't enjoy any of it but I've realised it gives me a chance of being able to work the next morning), as long as there's tons and tons of booze around, enough to get me to blackout. My face is effectively unrecognisable, my eyes have sunk into my skull and look quite greyish. Don't even get me started on what's going on inside my mouth. I'm also covered in scars and boils from self-harm and random drunken accidents. My periods have become wildly irregular.

I've also been on SSRIs for depression since 2016. I used to be physically active even while binging (on days off, obviously) but that's gone with lockdown. Alcohol-wise, I asked for help from GPs and Turning Point and alcohol helplines and got literally zero. So I've accepted my fate.

I appreciate that even though I am utterly fucked, I am nowhere near as fucked as most of you guys. I humbly ask for your experience and expertise, so that I know what's coming. Is this how it starts? The tolerance just builds up? What are the next steps I should expect? I don't believe there's any way out of this. But I can't die just yet, I don't think. 

TL;DR - Functional but feel like I'm crossing into crippling, desperate to hear about other people's experience

She gave me her boyfriends number and said he will give me whatever I need. Yesterday, while drunk as hell from vodka I called him for a delivery. I went outside wearing something kinda skimpy and he commented on it. 

When I got back to my apartment I blacked out. During this black out I texted him several naked photos and audio messages about how much I wanted to fuck him. I was apparently very horny in blackout state. 

Fortunately he didn’t come by but he sent me a lot of stuff back. When I came to the next day, I looked through my texts and freaked out. I immediately texted him that I was wasted and to please forgive me for everything. 

He said it was cool and that he won’t tell his gf but I’m worried she knows. Normally she’s very chatty when I see her but now she’s just cold. I’m pretty sure she knows. Or maybe I’m paranoid but this is crazy. I still have six months left on my lease and she’s worked her for years so prob not gonna get fired.

you might like to read it (rum&)coke by coke...



Hello my fellow crippled asswipes

I have always studiously analysed myself within my addictions/illness/true love/whatever you want to call it, partly out of curiosity but mostly as a defence mechanism

so if somebody tried to ‘help’ me, usually by harshly unveiling my Great Problems (as they saw them) back to me in order to ‘scare me straight’, I could just deadpan stare them, being like

“yeah... I know. I’m a drunk drug-addicted bulimic, utterly broke, homeless, alone and without prospect, and yep, all I want to do right now is 10 shots and 20 nangs.

yeah! I know right, it’s fucked up, I know. it’s sad, yep, I know. no surprises here.”

I purposefully think through all the mental pains and anguish of my fucked up story, ALONE, before anyone else may try to reveal it to me, so that I never have to give anyone the satisfaction of saving or changing me.

to undermine their attempts to undermine my addiction. like FUCKAyouuuuuuu - no one’s helping me! I’m in this alone and I will take that forever, thank you very much.

it comes with the positive of great self-awareness and sometimes good harm minimisation skills (if I have a shred of self worth that day). 

and the negative of the lowest lows not bothering me at all because I’ve already prepared for them. so it seems that nobody and nothing, not even myself, can scare or manipulate or convince me into changing because I’ve already sussed out the pain/fear/feelings of the bottom of the barrel and accepted them.

only thing that will change me is if I decide I actually, deep down from the core, WANT to change it.

and what the fuck is gonna make that happen? it has to be something more poignant and important to me than the feeling of escaping my physical body and limitations.

anyway, yeah a realisation of this thing that I do. please tell me anyone if you relate?

there’s this great divide in the mind that it causes too... I’ll ‘know’ something (YA killing YASELF Pucky) and yet it would have literally 0% emotional impact on me to motivate change (I would WANT TO WANT to change but never actually WANT to change)

the clarity with which we all talk about alcoholism here gives me these same ‘self awareness’ vibes. not to assume or diagnose; I’ve just never met someone else in real life who does that too.",1614772050

This Is A Scary Night,149,lvuhm2,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lvuhm2/this_is_a_scary_night/,48,"I did a real quick taper (as people do) and stopped drinking yesterday evening. At about 11 pm withdrawals were setting in a little worse than expected (I started having mild auditory hallucinations) so I popped an ativan and that put me to asleep. 

I woke up to my little brother in my bed. Wtf. He doesn't even live with me. I was startled and shot up and asked him what the hell he was doing here. 

""I didn't want my girlfriend or kid knowing I'm home so I thought I'd crash with you."" he says. My brother doesn't have a kid. Something's really wrong. I'm wondering if he's on something so I ask him a few questions: 

""Hey dude, where are you working right now?"" ""Waste management"" he says. Wrong. 

""Where do you live?"" He answers by naming a small town about 50 clicks away. Wrong. 

""Okay be honest with me, are you tripping on something right now?"" ""No"" he says. ""I just need a place to stay tonight and I'll explain it all tomorrow I promise."" 

Whatever. I'm tired. Fine. I turn back around to go to sleep. As I'm about to drift off, I see a shadow outside my room and hear a voice call my name. It's my mom. She doesn't live with me either. What the fuck is going on. 

I get out of bed and wander over. As I get up my brother says ""Don't talk to her."" I replied that I'll just be a minute. My mom asks what all the commotion is. I tell her that my little brother (also her son) is having a rough time and talking gibberish but that he's safe with me tonight. 

I then (for whatever reason) mention to my mom about my hallucinations and that I've been hearing voices. That's when things get weird. My brother starts yelling threatening things like ""Leave! Don't talk to her! DON'T FUCKING TALK TO HER!"" 

I turn to my mom and say sorry about that, I don't know what's up with him. My mom looks back at me. ""Sorry for what?"" 

Oh. She can't hear him. A shiver runs down my spine. ""Mom?"" I say. ""Come to my room with me."" I lead her to my room and my little brother is sitting there, silently staring at me with the biggest grin on his face. I ask her ""Do you see him there?"" 

""I don't, son."" I then put it together. I'm in my own apartment. The only people that are actually here are myself and my roommate. I look at my brother. I look at my mom, who begins smiling at me and asks ""what's wrong?"" Paranoia sets in... they know I know. I immediately start to run, and as soon as I start to run, I hear these terrible screams coming from inside my apartment. Awful, awful screams. 

To my great relief I woke up. My hand was on my apartment's door knob. I was dreaming. It was just one of those weird dreams where you think you wake up so it doesn't occur to you that it's a dream. When you live this kind of lifestyle, the lines between reality and your imagination are blurred. I couldn't distinguish between the two tonight. 

I know I'm the biggest pansy ever posting about my scary dream, but I figured maybe you all could relate with similar dreams (or real life hallucinations) while withdrawing. I'm lying here shaking and don't wanna fall back asleep. Popped another ativan though so we're gonna be okay. Chairs.",1614690581

Been through the gambit of alcohol abuse... Blackouts, withdrawals, vomiting stomach-lining, piles etc... My story is much too long to tell it all here but I've drank for different reasons throughout my life. I've always loved drinking and few things have ever brought me as much pleasure. I don't ever want to stop completely but I do have a fairly newfound desire to be healthier. I'm having a daughter in May and want to be around for many years for Her and Her Mother... Although I understand that I have about as much control over when I die as I did being born. I've really cut down quite a bit but would still be considered a very heavy drinker. Anyway with my newfound concern for my health I decided to have a checkup with the doctor to find out where I am... To gauge how much I can get away with. To my surprise I'm fit as a fiddle with no signs of liver dysfunction/damage. I don't understand how this can be... Although I'm very pleased with the results and suddenly have a new lease on life. I was scared because I've lost friends to alcohol related illnesses and they were seemingly much healthier than  and drank not nearly as much as me. I really don't know how to explain this. I'm not particularly healthy. I smoke a carton of American Spirits every 2 weeks (I love tobacco and feel a deep spiritual connection to smoking the plant). I also drink about 2 pots of strong black coffee every day. I was afraid I was going to have to give up drinking and I'm enthralled with the idea that I can have it all... Of course I do not mock fate nor the irony with which it prevails. Anyway just kind of shocked... Maybe somebody can offer some insight.",1614732907

Next morning, Saturday, I felt better, a little bit of the chills but my headache was back to a very low buzz. So of course I started pouring shots around lunchtime, it was a day off. Drank my usual amount for a day off probably. White Rum mostly. 

Yesterday, Sunday, I woke up with a much more noticable headache. I put off drinking for a while as I was getting laundry and groceries done, but of course I had a plan for what to drink before I finished walking the dog. I picked up some tallboys of dry cider (no sugar added) while getting the groceries and probably around 2pm I started cracking them open and drinking whisky on the side.

got my third dui at the end of 2019. because of this fuckin covid shit i didnt get sentenced for 11 months. ended up getting 3 years of probation. 

&#x200B;

prior to sentencing i took a real hard look at my life and decided it was time to get my act together ( 3rd DUI at 30, yea i'd say its been overdue) i actually got sober for the first time in my adult life. i tried to check into a rehab but i was immediately triggered by a guy that used to hang out with my dad and presumably probably used to smoke crack with him too (good ol generational trauma am i right guys? !) so i quickly said fuck that shit and walked out. grabbed a 40 for my troubles on the way back to my familys place. fuckin loser right? since i started probation ive gotten 3 sanctions for relapses in about a 5 month span. The good woman that i was a piece of undeserving shit to? she got fed up and kicked me out , as she should. I really aint shit anyway. been on a three day binge that is continuing as i type this. Friday night i got so black out stupid drunk that i jumped out of my cousins car and KNOCKED MYSELF THE FUCK OUT by falling. got a couple bad bumps on my head and i think (?) i was puking blood but then again, i was blacked out drunk and dont remember shit. last night was said cousins baby shower and i did some coke and got damn near black out drunk yet again and pretty sure one of my other cousins got this face obliterated with a glass beer mug , punched a car window out and almost got ran over. shits in my blood yall lol. so now i have mysterious cuts all over my arms which im assuming is from being in proximity to the action. snapped my glasses in half too. im such a fuckin idiot.

&#x200B;

Staying sober is proving to be impossible for me. i started a really good treatment place and have an awesome counselor that supports the hell out of me, but even still i guess im just too much of a fuck up and or too damaged to not consistently let everybody down. my head fuckin hurts but im gonna keep drinking. at least this last 6 pack. then maybe ill pretend for a few more weeks or some shit if i dont get piss tested soon enough for the system to catch me. im flirting with jail at this point and honestly more often then not lately i just want them to lock me the fuck up. let the world forget about me for awhile. it'd be cheaper then having to pay a probation fee monthly and all these damn fines anyway.

That might be a fun change of pace.


Overheard conversations at the booze shop. It made me stabby, so I wrote this.


Chairs, you beautiful fucks...

--------------------------

I hate their fucked up romanticism.


I loathe the irritating words spewing from the plastic cup people who laugh and joke about the paultry amounts of poison they poured into their still healthy and balanced bodies.


Not constantly under the specter of crippling addiction, they are free to banter and brag.  And they constantly compare notes about their ridiculous parties, desperate to somehow define themselves in the number of drinks supposedly consumed.  They inflate their stories of drunkenness, like mediocre high school athletes already at the pinnacle of their achievement, just to make themselves seem somehow more interesting. 


Or even edgy.


But I cannot help but to see them for what they are- transparent posers.  Weekend pretenders.  People, as plastic as their red weekend cups, hiding behind booze to mask their own crushing shortcomings.


Because despite their temporary setbacks, they can still function.  In spite of my best intentions, my hands remain stubbornly paralyzed with shakey uselessness.


They lurch through the hilarity of their sporadic hangovers, while I am caught in the constant degrading hussle, scrambling to avoid another terrifying withdrawal.


They still have their McMansion homes and cookie-cutter families and friends, while I am surrounded only by the empty victims of my own naked codependent attachments.


I may be a hollow husk of a drunk, but at least I am fucking honest about it.  I simply don't have the energy or motivation to try lying about it anymore.  Because that game of hiding the bottle stopped being fun years ago. 


Despite her very best efforts, I would always win that game. And that always seemed to piss her off more than anything else, when I would successfully find where she had hidden my sin.   That diligence earned me the mental victory lap of watching the one person I love walk away in understandably disgusted resignation.


It was then that I knew what I was... and who I had become. But by that point, it was already too late.  The damage had been done to the both of us and I had no choice but to go my own way, brittlely kindeled.


I don't blame her for leaving.  I didn't really love me, either.  The best that I could do when we were together was to daily attempt drowning the darker angels of my intemperate nature.  Yet it was never quite enough to finish the job properly.  So I could only pour down more.


Never once was I close to satisfied.


Never once did I realize just how constantly flawed and constricted I had become within the confines of that fragile glass.


I cannot even remember the last time it was actually... fun.


I feel trapped.  


I am drowning in the measured pour of a self-inflicted ocean, but I'm still sure as fuck going to take that next drink. 


Because that's just what supposedly worthless drunk fucks are supposed to do.

*What does it taste like???* 

""I uhhh...  Uhh?""  

Swill?  Solace.  Contrition?  Composure. 

What is this?  Is this a real question or is he mocking me?  I can tell it's the former because there's light in his eyes as he scans my bottle.  This isn't where you wanna start, man.  This isn't where you want to end either; but at least that makes some semblance of sense.  Do I look like a refined proprietor of fine spirits?  I don't.  I look like it's five minutes to close and I chose here over my bed—barely.  

...what does it taste like? 

It has notes of isolation and smokey undertones of connectedness.  It pairs well with the thin winter air and is reminiscent of voices in the fan.  It tastes like fugacious life and protracted death.  It nestles in heavy inside your stomach as a soothing, leaden burn that bubbles and burbles its way up to your head, cooling as it rises.  It tastes like the present.  Y'know, like how they say to live in the now?  It tastes like the now when the bottle is full in front of you.  When the same bottle's nearing empty it tastes like choking on the stark, metallic hands of an old wall clock; further obscuring your airways as each successive tick echoes louder inside your trachea, building to a crescendo marked by a fretful, convulsing future.  

It tastes like a Hobson's choice.  It tastes just like all the others because it doesn't matter what it tastes like.

I finally fucked up enough,178,ltsvyz,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ltsvyz/i_finally_fucked_up_enough/,109,"I did it.  I finally pushed people over the edge.  My wife and I were at a stalemate- sure, I was drinking myself stupid every night, but I wasn't doing anything terrible enough she could call me out on it.  Until Thursday.  I done fucked up on Thursday.

My wife wears the pants in the family, I have come to accept that.  The only place where I still demand to have any say is in our financials.  We both make really good money, but don't ever seem to have any, because she spends a lot on herself and our kid.  On Thursday, she makes a commitment to rent a 2nd band instrument for the kid without running it past me.  Fine, I let it go.  But then the charge was much more than I expected- turns out you had to buy a book and reeds and other crap.  By this time I had sank some rum...

And I got pissed.  I went through waves of letting it go, then being angry, let it go, be angry.  It really would have helped if the wife would have just said something like ""yeah, sorry, I should have asked you first,"" but we both like to double down when we are wrong instead of apologize.

More rum down the hatch, and I'm just stewing over this.  She has recently started a diet app that we are paying for that basically tells her to not eat shit food.  I walk into the kitchen and see she is stuffing her face with Chex Mix, and I hand her a carrot, telling her that will be $10, since she is paying the app to tell her the same thing, and she's clearly not paying attention to it.  I question why we are paying for the app if she is stuffing face.  I may have said some other stuff about her penchant for eating, I don't know.  

This is where it gets more hazy.  She left for a drive at some point she was so pissed off.  Relevant to the story, I believe this is PMS week, which has been hitting her hard lately.  Not that it makes things right, here- I am the asshole in all this, she just takes my assholery more seriously during PMS time.

I wake up the next morning, and we are ignoring each other.  I check my digital stuff (email, messages, discord, etc) and notice I'm no longer in a discord group I'm usually in.  Hmm.

At work I get a call from a motorcycle dealer about the motorcycle I'm about to finance.  Wait, what? Ohh, right, in my drunken anger I told her if she wasn't going to run purchases past me, I didn't need to run purchases past her, and I tried to buy a motorcycle online.  I got really close! The dealer wanted to know when I was picking it up.

I got a message from the person who runs the discord I was mysteriously no longer in.  She wanted to make sure I was OK.  Sure, I am, why? She didn't tell me exactly what I said, but it had something to do with grabbing her titties, in a public area in the discord where a lot of her friends saw what I was saying, as well as some teenage children.  Geez, I really was a complete asshole.

So, after work on Friday, I talk to the wife when she gets home.  I apologize.  Its clear the only way out of this is to quit drinking, its clear she is done with my bullshit.  I had been tossing around the idea of quitting for a while anyways, so I guess this is as good a time as any.  I had to explain why this time would be different than my 30 other promises to quit drinking.  I convinced her, barely, that it would be different this time.  I did negotiate to be able to take my Naltrexone and still have a few drinks every now and again, as Naltrexone seems to allow me to do.  But, this is it, folks.  I'm hanging it up.  I was made to choose between my family and my 2nd love- rum.  I'm almost 40 and have been doing this for 15 years now, the last 10 of which I've been going at it pretty damned hard.  I'll miss you, the booze, the lifestyle, the people, but not the impending health problems and consistent familial problems.

I'll keep reading the crazy shit you lunatics write, pretending I'm there while you get on with your shenanigans.  It's been fun.  Please take bets on how long this lasts.

Then there's the broken promises. ""i swear I'll go to church with you? I swear I'll go to the emergency room with you. But the time comes and they're passed out or they have no memory of it.

Ive been on both sides of these scenarios. I'm currently the alcoholic because my roomie is getting sober. Its just as hellish as any other scenario in this situation.

I can’t imagine a different life,65,ltx19w,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ltx19w/i_cant_imagine_a_different_life/,28,"How fucking BORING would it be to just... wake up at a reasonable hour, clear-headed, no mess to clean up, no texts to apologize for, no mad dash to the liquor store to stave off the WDs. 

I’ve experienced it, in short bursts of sobriety. You wake up and feel great and exercise and willingly eat food (not just because you know you have to or else you’ll be on a fast track to puking blood.) You get shit done, you make plans, you tell the very few friends you have left that its different this time, you hate alcohol, you hate drinking, you hate yourself. They believe you (again), you do ok for a week or two (again) and then its back to daily drinking, cancelling plans, quitting your job, laying in bed for 23 hours a day, drunk-texting exes for Valium (again). 

Don’t get me wrong - I hate this life. I’m exhausted and miserable. I’m running out of money and time and health and relationships. But, at least the alcohol provides some entertainment. I can’t imagine being sober, not thinking about alcohol, not slamming a half pint before any and all social interactions just to feel normal. Gotta answer the door for food delivery? Because you haven’t eaten in 4 days and obviously can’t fucking drive anywhere or be fucked to cook anything? Sounds like a wonderful excuse to drink. Let me answer the door reeking of vodka and vodka vomit, barely dressed, can’t see straight. It’s pathetic and embarrassing and exciting as hell. 

My life is boring and I’m addicted to chaos. I’m a fat lazy middle class drunk with absolutely zero real problems, so fuck you, life, I’ll create my own problems. Fight with your SO over bullshit, have an expensive drinking problem and no stable income, intentionally don’t eat so that the damage from alcohol is accelerated, create an eating disorder in the process, disown yourself from your family for no reason so that you have no social support network, etc. 

It’s like a dog left alone at home all day. Is it their fault they chewed up the couch, or is it your fault for buying a working breed and then leaving them trapped in a box for 8+ hours a day? I can’t function without alcohol, but I’m not allowed to function with alcohol. What do people expect?

This ended up being a lot moodier than I intended. Hope y’all are having a wonderful drunk Saturday. And, if you aren’t, I hope that at the least you are not having a boring day.",1614487865

...as opposed to me who pays stupid amounts to consult with psychiatrists about Naltrexone, reads the latest alcoholism medical literature, consults with you fine folks on the struggles and get this...

**have even been faithfully doing AA for 2 months.** Every single fucking day, many times 2x, before its even light outside. I never thought I’d try AA, but I’m desperate as all hell and, you know what, against all odds, it’s kept me clean. 

In other words, I have been working on this alcoholism shit from every aspect possible. Scientifically, spiritually, psychologically. 

Still. Because my wife’s (different sets of divorced) parents can get lonely, they demand we visit them. 10 hours away on the road in another state for a week. 

Not like there’s a once in a century pandemic! Who cares, this is what you put up with when married, whatever.

In the last, this would normally demand rounds upon rounds of secret drinking just to get through the tedium of the week.

The obligatory smiley “yes, I will play the part of the good husband/son-in-law and pretend (very well!) I’m so interested in your hobby for hours upon end” social dance. 

I’ll pretend (and do plenty of research so I can speak intelligently on matters of) fucking pool water quality – her father’s profession – and glass blowing (her mother’s).

Whatever, back to my bitching. I’ve been a sober Boy Scout. 2 months. Calling into fucking AA meetings at 5:30am and noon every day.

But. Because of my former CA life, I guess I have empty nips (airplane size bottles) stashed everywhere. I throw on some slacks to attend a party her parents are throwing... and a few hours into said party, my wife calls me out – in front of everyone, in front of those who staged an intervention – for a nip sticking out of my back jeans pocket.

A nip I hadn’t known was there. But the implication was I was off sneaking secret shooter booze again (who can blame me when I have to pretend to be interested in resort pool water quality parameters?!?) when no, I haven’t and wasn’t. 

You (read: I) can’t fucking win. 

You (read: I) be a goddamn paragon of trying to turn your life around, fucking writing sermons based on AA literature as you dial in to AA calls and fucking preach... only to have your wife discover a 6 month old empty nip in a pair of pants you haven’t worn in a year and call you out as the whole family folds their arms and shakes their heads like “well, we knew it. This guy’s a lost cause.”

Fuck this. Fuck this all to hell. 

I leave this goddamn in-law place tomorrow. Before I do, I’m getting up at 6 am and getting a fifth of Tito’s as a symbolic middle finger to all these fuckers who do not understand the CA struggle and how I *have fucking tried* in myriad ways – doctors, medical literature, cognitive behavioral therapy, and even service positions in fucking AA groups in Maryland and Colorado (despite me living in California!) – that they cannot wrap their minds around. 

Once I get back home, I’m going on the bender of a lifetime. I gave my attempt at sobriety my fucking all. But god forbid, and old ass empty shows up, sticking out of my pants. 

I’m going to drink and drink and drink and order a bunch of dumb stupid expensive shit off Amazon that I won’t even get to enjoy because I’ll just be in bed drinking.

Bring on the debt, the sorrow, and seven kitchen appliances I won’t discover until April, wondering why the hell I have 7 Instant Pots, before checking my Amazon history and seeing its well last the return window.

**Edit:** I wrote it as though wife called me out blatantly. Not wholly true... she just has no ability to whisper nor the tact to pull me aside and point it out away from everyone.

But lets get some real tips, tips that keeps us from death and at least keeps us functioning.

I'll start:

Take super b vitamin complex once a day.

Take a multi vitamin once a day.

Keep hydrated with water or gatorade.

When you drink, no social media.

Make sure you keep your job, only maintenance drinking if you have to work next day.

DONT BE HONEST WITH YOUR BOSS ABOUT YOUR DRINKING!!!!

Employers hate alkies. They are unreliable, if they know you are one they will be understanding... It is a trap and they will do their best to get rid of you. Dont need someone who calls in sick after a bender.

EAT, wetbrain is no joke. No coming back from that.

If you drink to blackout regularly, do it in private. Otherwise jail is likely.

Have you tried to capture the initial moment when you transition from a semblance of white-knuckled sober consciousness to the fleeting state of anticipated drunken disregard? 

The moment of relief, for me, arrives in the form of numbed lips and a tattered veil lifted from my eyes.

I actually get the sensation of awakening to a new dawn, of seeing more clearly, of being less restrained. 

I find myself in front of the bathroom mirror, gripping, with both hands, onto the cold, shiny counter. My head is lowered, though I’m slowly, deliberately, lifting it up and taking two to three deep breaths as I do. 
My tightened muscles melt away, as I roll my head from side to side. Then, staring into the mirror, I flick soft strands of hair away from my face and can’t help but to marvel at my apathy. 

I am simply existing: My thoughts and actions driven by an unseen aggressor that wills me to place one foot in front of the other, simultaneously keeping me sober enough to maintain these automatisms and drunk enough to feel lucky. 

Predictably, unsurprisingly, my dependency quickly steals all semblance of hopeful propriety; It undermines my struggling determination to remain in control, to trust my better judgment, to keep my empty promises.",1614344638

Saturday my mom took me to a flea market. I’d started drinking at sunrise. My favorite. This particular flea market has a booth full of classic books, $3 a pop. I bought $60 worth and while I was getting rang in , I saw an old lady with an armful of puzzles and I called her over to be added to my tab.

i cleaned up my room a bit yesterday. much more to be done. really though. as soon as i can pass off this thing to andy and his bro (co-workers) i may as well shoot my shot. its so pathetic. i have that bottle of **Smirnoff**  staring at me. so many times. ive been reading these reddit posts about people who despite there alcoholism are more successful then me. i still need to delete Instagram. im just so sad. and tired of trying. how do people do it. its amazing.

im just waiting for my hair to dry. i plan on cooking some tonight. he had dinner at like eleven last night. i wish these schedules never considered. i remember when i wrote that rice poem. maybe i should just go back to doing that. im starting to feel a little extra sad. i want to buy this headband but i also want to buy drugs. i could go for some stuff im not having. spiritual blockage. how long does it really take for hair to dry. i remember going there. and . gotta defeat the Instagram. i don't think ill get to nimble writer today.

could really go for some cuddles. i was reading someone saying how they wake up and get cuddles before going on with there day. yet he still drinks. i have this idea that if i had that i wouldn't drink, or that i have to quit drinking to get that. its Friday. wait no its Thursday night. close enough. i could go for some comfort tonight. i guess maybe it was Saturday i had a a bit of it. maybe i don't deserve it. it makes sense though. i have tomorrow to do the shit. at least im on just beer now so that's good. though its funny that im buying cases now. makes more sense. one guy said he has three. two to four cases a week. im about to be on my third, though im not sure the deli im about to go to has bud light. at least ive been able to keep to that mostly. a potato will be cool. i want to cool up those sandwich tonight. my body doesn't processes the drink too well these days it seems. could really go for some cuddles. it’s really not worth remembering the last time. especially if it was over a week ro so ago. i remember getting some release though when i let myself drink up. might just drink a whole twelve pack tonight by myself who knows.

like taj said(my employer). im addicted. it sucks. im just gonna go ahead and do what i do and. i guess technically i drank a lot of beer before i was really into the Instagram. but at least it was just here. sometimes coffee lol. too bad my thermos is fucked. and my organs.

i just have to do what i have to do. i feel like I’m chasing a wall here. at least my life's not that boring. ill get to finishing cleaning too at some point. sometimes when it comes do to drinking ya gotta drink a lot before to you can stop. but like just beer this time i swearer. like pbr or something. it'd be cool if I could get the money back from my thing. it might've been better if i didn't get seltzer and instead got the normal stuff. idk. last night i drank six and the night before i had more. eight. i don't think ill be having less then six tonight. especially if i start sooner then alter. but we'll see. i don't see the point in not drinking. like what the fuck. how could someone just stop drinking. i drank those last four two fast. i should wait for my hair to dry a bit more but im getting impatient. that has nothing to do with it. id be drinking just as much. more recklessly. but it'd have a different tinge to it. im not sure. so tired of people. realistically i don't even want a realization with m. maybe id rather just keep drinking. especially if she's going to treat me the way she did a last time. it'd be nice o get a little release.",1614337395

I stopped by the store for “a pint and a few shooters” and have been a 5th of vodka deep by noon since then.

I'm a selfish piece of shit,12,lr6egy,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lr6egy/im_a_selfish_piece_of_shit/,26,"Edit: TL:DR at end. If you just wanna read that then do you really care? Probably not so gtfo 

Last Friday, I was at a party at my friends. I got drunk as fuck, broke some shit, which he didn't care about (he being homeowner, very chill I see him as a friend almost a father, he's a fair amount older than me). 

A coworker, Erin, was there among others. The first week I worked at Treetops she caught my eye and I fell in love at first sight. I quickly learned my friend had been with her or trying to for some time, so I gave up. 

At that party, I drank so much more than I wanted to, I broke down and basically told her and my friend (host) how I've almost killed myself at least 5 times in the he last two weeks, almost 3 weeks now. No attempts since last Thursday which I'm proud of.

She invited me to her daughters bday party Tuesday, Feb. 23rd. I agreed cause I was drunk, and also she's fucking gorgeous and so nice and  I'm a good reader of people, and as far as I know she's everything and more that I look for in a first date. Anyways, she texted me the next morning to confirm I was coming. She obviously knew I was drunk af when she asked and wanted to be sure I remembered. It was like 10am at the time, next morning after drinking, and I was still drunk when I woke and saw it, and was trying to figure out how to get to work safely by 12.

Luckiky I sobered up just enough in time, and my supervisor was at the party so he knew what was up. He helped me out.

That's besides the point. Sorry if I go on tangents I'm so fucking drunk rn.. Lol.

Basically, I said yeah. Saw her at work and I was so happy to see her as always. She actually went our of her way to say hi cause I was busy and didn't notice it was time for her to clock in. So nice of her.

Finally yesterday came, she asked me in the morning if I was coming again? and I wasn't feeling it. I didn't have the heart to say that to her cause I feared she really did care, she had mentioned it's a date that drunken night. I just thought she felt bad for me and that's why she said all that and inviyed me. I ignored her for a couple hours. Fuck me right?

Boy was I wrong. Today, after I ignored her at first then she tried again to get ahold of me few hours later, I just decided to be honest with her. Told her I thought she just felt bad for me, how I wasn't doing well mentally cause I had a rough night (failed to mention the rough night cause I'm fucking worthless), she said she understood if I need to take a mental health day,but said before that she'd be sad if I didn't come.

Here's the kicker. She said she was actually excited to introduce me to her mom. Wow. I've only been asked out one time in my life, and I'm an Incel awkward fuck around ladies, so I honestly didn't believe it. But when she told me this I knew she really does care and wants to get to know me. 

I felt like an even bigger piece of shit for canceling last minute after that. I'm honestly surprised she invited me to come over next week instead. But I'm so grateful too. I've wanted to date her since my first week of meeting her,i finally get the chance to meet her whole family and I fuck it up. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me. I feel so bad.

I only think of myself even if it is out of depression or anger. 

I just hope I didn't fuck up my chances of making a good impression on her parents.

I figured I'd just stick with my policy of honesty that hadn't ever failed me. If her parents wanna know why I wasn't there then I'll tell them strsight up. If they don't respect my honesty, then do I rally need these people in my life?

If Erin's parents are anything like her then I know they'll understand. 

At the same time I feel like I shouldn't be dating cause if my mental state.

I love kids more than I love my life cause they have more life to live than me. I don't want my negative vibes / influences to affect her kid's life. Neither Erin or her kid deserves that. 

But if she knows all this and still is interested then maybe this is the wake up call I've been waiting for for years. Just hope I didn't fuck it up.

I guess if it's meant to be then I'll figure out a way to make it work. I just hope I didn't already fuck it up. 

Fuck me.

TL:DR

I'm a lieve of shit who turned down a girl last minute and she says it's OK and invited me over next week but I really hope I didn't fuck this up cause she so important cause I've wanted a chance with her for do long now and I finally got it then fucked it up caus  I'm a CA piece of shit kms


Edit 2: I'll let yall know next week or this weekend if it goes well. I'm gonna pull her aside in person at work sometime and talk to her about all this. Feel like even if we texted about it alrwsdy, she'd appreciate me for wanting to discuss it face to face. 

I just think it's more personal and I also wanna make sure that I am a piece of work rn, but that she makes me wanna be better not only cause she has a kid amd I need to be better for her kid of I want a chance wirh her, but also because she is what mattered to me first and if she can really see past my shit and see the real me and still wanna date me and INTRODUCE ME TO HER MOM, then she's worth my efforts. I just hope I didn't already fuck it up.


Fuck my dumbass worthless piece of shit selfish self. Hope I don't wake up tomorrow so I don't gotta deal with this fucking stress. But if I do then it's worth it cause she the first one in years to make me wanna change, make me wanna take care of myself.

a moment’s peace, aye, sounds pretty good!

you wish you were dead when you sober up?

you can be dead, and while alive still, if you let go of it all and live in that timeless wasteland for a little longer... and a little longer...

This is from the time we visited Davis and I requested Sharan put me to work in her area of the greenhouse to get a feel for what she was up to. I wanted to help with grunt work for an experiment she was working on involving tomato plants. She had me take pollen from a certain breed of tomato plant and smear it onto the stigma of another tomato plant. Once I got the hang of it, I quietly sung 'Can't Get Enough of Your Love Baby' to myself while I helped these plants reproduce. I know she caught the low hum of me singing to myself but I didn't think she knew what it was. She took this photo of me and the caption indicated she caught the little dad joke I was telling myself.

In a sense, the concept of transactive memory backs up a truth in the notion that when a loved one dies, a part of you does in fact go too. Those things about you they know that you don't are gone. And I love this Idea because it's a relic of a stupid joke I didn't realize I was telling outside of my own head. It must have induced a little head shake and eye roll from a very perceptive friend. Maybe a smile too. I can't say. That angle isn't my memory. It went with her. Oddly, that's a comforting thought.",1613893333

Here's my week:  I've been sober for 23 days and counting, and it's a miserable state.  On my last bender in January, I drank about a gallon and a half of vodka over a 3~4 day period, called in to work a bunch and almost got fired.  My supervisors were actually pretty supportive when I finally told them what was going on.  Joke's on them, though, I just started a new job on Thursday.  I actually feel like an asshole for quitting after they didn't fire me.  Oh well.

Tapering, detoxing and sobering up is getting harder and harder, though.  Next time I'll probably have to go to the hospital, so I'm trying really hard for there not to be a next time.  I'm supposed to see a behavioral specialist, but the next available appointment isn't until March.  I'm white-knuckling it until then.  I'm hoping I can get some depression or anxiety meds and maybe give naltrexone another shot.  We'll see.

The biggest problem is always boredom.  I've been cooking non-stop (see r/CA_Kitchen for details), and I just built a charcuterie ""room"" in my basement to hang and age salamis and such (which constitutes my non-drinking plans for the weekend).

How about all of you?  What are your wins for the week and hopes for the future?

Not Steve,269,llz8dh,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/llz8dh/not_steve/,129,"There's a liquor store I stop at in the morning on my way to work on Mondays and Wednesdays. I go to the one near my house during the weekend and on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday I walk to my other office going a different route so I stop at the one on the corner where I also usually get lunch. I have a very set schedule and routine. This is all a little beside the point.

Last week, I walked into my usual store at my usual Wednesday morning time. I saw my usual cashier Steve. I got my usual fifth of Titos. We exchanged our usual pleasantries and I went along my way. I like Steve. He is a nice guy. He is very obviously aware that I have a problem and he has mentioned this exactly zero times because he does not act like a judgmental person and also probably recognizes that it's none of his business.

This past Monday morning, I again walked into that usual store. But there was no Steve. I don't know where Steve was but the store still had Titos and frankly that is more important to me than Steve. I picked up my usual bottle, put it on the counter and said good morning to this new cashier. This guy looked down at the bottle, looked back up to me and said ""Getting started a little early today don't you  think?""

Now, on Mondays and Wednesdays I actually do not drink during the day at work because I drive on those days. I just like to get my bottle before work because the store I go to is on that side of the road with the direction of traffic plus I don't like having to run any errands after and just want to get home, out of my work clothes, and have a glass in hand ASAP. And rather than tell his guy to fuck off and ring up my bottle I actually TOOK THE TIME TO FUCKING EXPLAIN THIS TO HIM!! I spent the rest of that day replaying it in my head over and over, feeling like a goddamn moron.

I went back to that store this morning on my way in to work. Still no Steve. It was that other guy again. Where the hell are you Steve? I avoided eye contact with him, and quickly walked down the aisle to get my bottle. I took it up front, silently placed it on the counter, and reached into my pocket for my wallet.

""Wow, you go through this stuff pretty fast huh?""

I looked back up at him and he was almost smirking. I left the bottle on the counter and walked out.

I know I shouldn't let jackasses like him get to me. Some people judge, especially about things they don't even understand. But I've been fuming about this all morning. And the whole rambling fit I spewed at him on Monday, as if he was owed some sort of explanation, only makes it worse. Fucking prick.

I miss my bartenders,155,llr49i,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/llr49i/i_miss_my_bartenders/,23," 

I miss my bartenders.

My ex-wife made me stop going out to bars even before we, she, decided we, she, should stop drinking. 

I went to bars because I loved the social aspect, You met people. You got drunk. You watched movies or Youtube vids. Or just listened to music. Mostly, though, it was the bartenders I liked most. 

Because they chose the movies, they chose the music, they were in charge, they poured my drinks.

And when you tip 50% they pour you strong.

And when you aren’t an asshole they treat you right.

And when you know when to cut yourself off they respect that. They know which of us are alcoholics. And which of us are functioning alcoholics.

Names changed to protect the innocent.

Pirate Bar, not it’s real name.

Sy, my favorite bartender. Every Sunday I would show up after work and the bar would be nearly empty. He would pour a vodka tonic that would be mostly vodka. We would watch movies until close. Action, comedy, action-comedy, Mean Girls, weird foreign action movies, stupid Hollywood movies. Sy, always happy. Always pleasant. Always grateful to have me at the bar. Always ready to fill my drinks. Always shooting the shit with me. If someone was buying a round of the house shots- Vit-C’s- he always made sure I got one. No charge.

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Bill. The owner of the bar. A gruff man a few years older than myself. Always knew that I would want a vodka tonic. Always asked: “Double or single?” Never gave me a single. Bill is an alcoholic as well. Lived, or possibly still does live, above the bar. Plays video games. At the bar. Hated whenever anyone younger than 25 came in. Always told me which crazy bitch I should avoid. 

The Hipster Bar, it’s closed now.

Clair. A big fat girl who was only bartending because her therapy career hadn’t taken off yet. Mondays and Fridays. On Mondays after I got off work she would typically have no customers. I mean, a couple, myself and an African dude and two other weird guys. There would be a collection of people who were all studying coding but they wouldn’t drink anything except coffee. Clair liked to play 80’s comedies during her shift. But also, sometimes would just put Youtube on random weird music. She also poured hard for me. We smoked cigarettes together. 

Jake. Who took over for Clair when her therapy career took off. Jake had usually closed Saturdays and Sundays which were big nights for the Hipster bar. He added Monday and was disappointed that almost no one came in. We had similar taste in music and so he would play all our favorite music. Poured hard. Smoked with me. We got along well. 

My original bar. My 21 birthday bar. They guy who gave me my first legal drink.

Joe. A big man. Like, physically big. A brontosaurus of a man. But nice and happy unless you were a university kid who wanted to start shit. 

My first legal drink he asked what I wanted.

“Whiskey and Coke.” I said.

He looked at me. Smiled and asked for my ID. I gave it to him.

“Oh, it’s your birthday. This one is on me.” he said.

And then just poured me a whiskey. With a splash of Coke.

That was 1999.

He switched to the day shift which at that particular bar meant kindergarten teaching day drunks. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. My days off. I’d stop by in the middle of the day for a vodka tonic. Joe would pour mostly vodka and then splash some tonic.

We would talk sports some, I’m not well read up on the subject but can hold my own. Joe liked college basketball and baseball and hockey. Always had some sport on or at least Sportcenter.

The last time I saw Joe behind the bar was a year and a half ago.

My original bar began service again a few months ago. I don’t recognize anyone when I’ve walked by. Haven’t been in.

I miss my bartenders.

I miss the regulars.

I miss spending hard earned money to enjoy time with other drunks.

Mostly I miss that there was someone, on the other side of some plank, who knew that not only could my liver handle whatever they threw into a glass but that we could enjoy some movies or music or just talk. Or just not talk at all but just sit/stand and have a drink. And get numb together.",1613585078

Learning a new language on a drunken whim.,38,ller2z,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ller2z/learning_a_new_language_on_a_drunken_whim/,59,"Duolingo is making me feel bad today and I don’t remember downloading the app.

I vaguely remember deciding when meeting new people with an accent, It would be cool to able to speak their language back to seem more well-read. *This was not a well thought out idea.*

It’s impossible to remember any of the drunken lessons I took, especially when having difficulty remembering my first language these days, so I don’t remember much or what their meanings are. Example: I’ll hear a word but mistake it for something else. 

I tried to learn 3 languages at once and just blend them together now, (French, Spanish, Italian), I use them incorrectly 80% of the time.

Duolingo has laid the guilt trips on THICK since the motivation ran out.

It all started with, “Hey! It’s time for your Spanish lesson 🦉“, to “Hey! Today seems like a good day to brush up on your Spanish skills! 🦉”, and, “Hey, Is everything okay? You haven’t done your lessons in a while...”, then finally, “...These notifications don’t seem to be working, we are going to stop sending you messages now”.

Confessions,4,ll9ix9,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ll9ix9/confessions/,46,"I have witnessed the undeniable worst of humanity in naked, bleeding exposition.  


I have heard the wails of mothers mourning their fallen sons, the weighted burden of complicated guilt tattooed indelibly into my skin.


I have fallen wasted into the abyss of miscalculation and I came out the other side an unbalanced consequence of inhuman fallibility.


Unsequestered fragility bends and festers, fermenting constantly under the surface of transparent hesitation, feeding the unseen beasts lurking in the shadows where snarling temptations conspire and clash in the unceasing hunt for an unsatiated tranquility.  Left unfed to wither and expire in fields holding no honor, those compulsive desires instead suffer and lash out constantly in their ravenously addictive inconsistencies.
 

I am falling; I am failing.


I am a failure- by every measurable marker.


The karmic balance has shifted and stubbornly resists ever being tabulated in my favor.


I was born into this world a mistake.  And I will most likely die one, too.  


Unacknowledged.  


Isolated.  


Insignificant. 


Constantly falling into any welcoming bottle that will have me.  Making love to every narcotic influence that crosses my weaving, unsteady path.  Fucking anything that will have me, sacrificing my last few handfuls of integrity simply for the temporary bond of another warm body pressing up against my aging, yellowing skin.


Burdened with the exhaustion of feeling, I seek out the dull embrace of constant numbness. It is the closest that I ever feel to actually being alive, a refreshing break from the walking corpse I have somehow become.


Friends and family have long ago abandoned me.  Success and stability constantly mock and tease, standing on the unreachable periphery of my elusive salvation.  Always teasing, always tasting.  Always stealing away the last few shreds of my basic human dignity as I crumble and decompose in the detoxifying screams of another kindled nightmare.


But still that bottle calls to me.  It sings the symphony of my wintery discontent in seductive measures, leaving me no choice but to dance the same old unsteady steps in the rhythmed swigs of endless shot glass pours. 


The pills, they beckon and tease.  The needle stands ready to bite dirty, scabbed over skin.  The glass bowl shimmers and taunts, just waiting for the spark.


They are all permanent companions that offer only temporary absolution.  But the underlying sins never quite go away.


Because there is no lasting salvation.  There is no meaningful rehabilitation.  There are no solutions to the constantly nagging complications that I simply cannot understand.


There is no waking from this endless nightmare.  There is no finding the light again after years of  intentionally blacking everything out, day after day, year after year.


There is only me and the broken man staring back from a smudged and streaked mirror mounted to the wall of yet another foreign place.  There is only this fucking bottle that is never enough, no matter how many times it is replaced, constantly mocking that shaking reflection to take just one drink more.


Addicted.  


Expiring.

Fast forward a couple days after a shit ton of snow and I hear this fucking cat outside begging and meowing. The neighbors have already come over a couple times to borrow cat food and now they're leaving the cat outside in the cold, so, yeah. My drunk ass stole the damn cat back. She now lives in my bed and cuddles nonstop. I love this kitty and I'm straight up lying to a small child if they ask for her back. 

Tangentially related, I broke my nose a little. I thought I was just drunk enough to walk ok and ended up twisting something in my foot before hitting the ground face first. Glasses aren't broken, but foot is swollen and I can smell around a corner. Some CA on discord was kind enough to walk me around how to reset it myself without a hospital visit. So it's just a little bruised, everything smells like blood and it hurts to sniffle, something I can't stop doing. 

I probably shouldn't be taking medical advice from a drunk emt via video chat, but I can safely say that I really have not been thinking properly, if at all, the past few weeks.

I sometimes talk to myself, what if my heart stops today? When would they know? A week at least, I think. Not a soul that’ll call an ambulance for me, no one who at least would be at my side. Which made me think, why even try if the end is always a stop with nothing ahead?

I could drink my worries away, bringing me one step closer to inevitable every night, or I could get my life around, be healthy and productive, yet still be six feet under at one point or another. In that case, why even try if we’re temporary? Why should I worry about that I have been single my whole life and don’t even have a shoulder to cry on? To make things right?

I broke quarantine ONCE to drink with my friend at a bar for her birthday.


Started feeling shitty Tuesday, just got diagnosed with Covid today.


I’m only in my late 20s, my oxygen levels were good, and I don’t have a fever (slightly raised temp but no official fever so far), so doc wasn’t too worried about me. I did not tell him I’m a raging alcoholic though.


But fuck am I worried about the combination of alcoholism and Covid on my organs. If y’all remember, I’ve been thinking about doing rehab. I really don’t want to quit drinking but I also don’t want to die of organ failure at 30.",1613227482
Guys I need help- WD and vomiting,44,liskqe,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/liskqe/guys_i_need_help_wd_and_vomiting/,53,"Okay so this past week I got myself down to about 12 drinks a day. Yesterday I only had probably 9. Fast forward to this morning, I was doing okay for about an hour after I woke up and then suddenly I felt it coming and sprint to the bathroom to throw up.

I fucking explode. Probably a solid 4 minutes straight puking up literally everything in my system including just straight bile for the last 2 of those. These were the shaking convulsing sweating your ass off throw ups. And it's been going on now for about 12 hours. I try to drink some water, it will sit for about 10 minutes then I throw up. I try to drink a mixed drink to force some alcohol down. Throw up. My actual organs are hurting from throwing up at this point.

"another dead resident, flunking my engineering degree, botched covid vaccine?, re-entering the downward spiral",29,lijf1k,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lijf1k/another_dead_resident_flunking_my_engineering/,26,"I love you guys and gals. Wish I loved myself.  Sorry for the random post, I've been lurking for a long time and feel that I can't hold this in anymore, I really need to vent because you folks are the only ones that would understand.  

I work for a series of group homes, I love my residents and have become a big brother to them, I bath them, dress them, feed them, and am literally an extension of their bodies in the sense that I serve to do or perform any task that they themselves cannot, from something as mundane as reaching something on a high shelf to something as intricate as assisting with dressing / toileting / diaper changing / bathing, etc., including as intimate as wiping bottoms, vaginas, penises, whatever they need.

I'm considered a rockstar, everyone at my job loves me, residents and staff alike.  I've resisted numerous offers to promote me to a house manager, a track that eventually leads to district manager of several homes.  I don't want it.  I know I will burn out.  I'm a miserable CA.  I go to work and drink because I'm such a good caretaker that I can get away with it.  It's sick and disgusting but then again so am I.

I'm studying to become a software engineer.  Something I had no experience in but after making through advanced calculus, was heavily recommended to me by random professors.  

I've never achieved a college degree and its my biggest aspiration and I'm blowing it.  I've dropped so many classes that the university keeps threatening to block my future course registration.  It's bitterly painful considering that I""m literally 2 courses shy of fully graduating with not only a computer engineering degree but a minor in applied mathematics as well.  I'm currently failing my current course not because I cannot do it but because I can't stay sober long enough to actually tackle the coding projects.  I'm such a mess and I'm in so much internal distress about it. 

One of my residents died suddenly, they did him dirty.  He kept falling down and was so morbidly obese that getting him back up required frequent calls to the fire department.  The worthless house manager took way too long to get him into the hospital.  By the time he did, he was quickly diagnosed with terminal pneumonia (a weird version with no visible symptoms), he was quickly dispatched to hospice care.  Of course with covid, none of us could visit him, so he died being surrounded by absolute strangers, probably hooked up to uncomfortable breathing machines.  He had no family, the group home staff was his only family, and most horrendously, they never moved his records to his hospice unit.  He was an avid record collector and had an incredible record collection, nobody made the slightest effort to transport those records this hospice room as he was dying, it was probably the only thing that brought him any respite.  I'm so angry about that.  I loved hearing him play his records.  As someone born in 1985, hearing real records being played live was an extraordinarily rare occurrence that I've literally only experienced once or twice in my entire lifetime and I loved him for it.  His Johnny Cash collection alone was fucking epic and made me greatly enjoy reporting to work each week. 

Lastly, and this probably pails in comparison, but I was lucky enough to finally be offered a covid vaccine dose, luckily prioritized by random coincidence of my job, at any rate I was so fucking pathetic that, after receiving the dose, I proceeded to drink an entire 12 pack of high concentration IPA beer, which I fear may have seriously impeded my bodies immune response.  The following day, I was horrendously paralyzed by intense illness, was freezing cold with intense sweating and insane fatigue, just kept trying to sleep while physically shivering and dripping with sweat.  I already had covid months earlier and the symptoms were nothing near as intense, not even close, so I fear that my alcoholism probably ruined the effectiveness of the vaccine.  

Anyway I'm such a fucking mess, I'm so sorry to post such an insufferably long post, I just feel the need to vent and I can't handle my life anymore, fucking hate myself.  Im such a failure, I'm so troubled by the prospect of failing my degree due to being academically suspended by dropping yet another course or continuing through it with an F grade due to my lack of completing any coding assignments.  All I can do is drink and hate myself.

Currently I have more respect for you folks than I do for myself but I'm so grateful to be a member of your community.  I have, as always, continued to read and commiserate with all of your posts and feel closer to you wonderful people than literally anyone else in this world save for my beloved kitties.

I don’t mean to make this post a pity party or anything like that but I just want to share what happened to me with someone who will get it. 

So about a week ago I was at a shitty hotel drinking shitty vodka eating shitty food in a shitty bed. 
I ran out of money and I was waiting for my DoorDash check to come in. Something was fucked up with DoorDash accounting and it took over a day and a half for my money to get to me. 

By the time the money got to me I was so fucking sick I could barely fucking move!
So I ordered alcohol delivery to my hotel room, something was fucked up with them too so it took over two hours for the alcohol to get to me. When it finally got to me I was so sick I couldn’t even stand up I was trying to take shots and I couldn’t keep them down. 
This has never happened to me before!
 I have always been able to keep shots down despite whatever. Something this time was wrong, I was puking shot after shot after shot after shot no matter how much I mixed or sipped. 
I was scared shitless and I ran out of mixers so I went to the vending machine to get more and on my way there I fell to the ground and had a seizure so the hotel manager saw me and called 911. 
911 got there just in time my heart had stopped and they had to use a defibrillator on me. 
This was the reason they had called my mother and my mother was the one paying for the hotel. When I woke up in the ICU my mom was there and she told me I was completely cut off. When I signed out against medical advice I realized I had lost everything all I had was my car. I am really at a place y’all where there is nothing more for me but booze. I want to live but everything is just so hard with the alcohol. Im transgender too and that makes shit more difficult with just living life. 
I’m puking blood and I have stomach ulcers. I’ve lost all my friends and my family and right now I’m sitting in my car at the Jack in the box taking shots making this post. I just want to talk with some people who will understand I hope y’all will pray for me or light a candle or cross your fingers or whatever you do because I’m about to die and I’m scared shitless and I just wanted y’all to know that I love you and y’all are the only ones who get me be safe OK? - Stella",1613013268

Explaining a drunk firing at an interview,18,lh4vte,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lh4vte/explaining_a_drunk_firing_at_an_interview/,46,"Apologies if you saw this already but I had to make a repost per some “suggestions” so here we go.

Alright I posted about this in another sub but it didn’t really get traction so I’m going to ask about it here. I got fired from my job a little after New Years bc I’m a weak little bitch that went on a two week bender right after Xmas. I managed to work one week while tossed but the next week I just couldn’t do it bc I started having body issues (in hindsight i probably should’ve went to the hospital). It didn’t get any better either each day was a crawl to the toilet, endless shitting of blood and migraines. Ended up telling my boss I was going to be out all week and I’ll see him on Monday. 

Monday comes around and HR ends up giving me a call telling me my behavior is unacceptable “blah blah go fuck your self theG2apist you are fired” first virtual firing too which is pretty hilariously tragic for me. Well after hearing that and shedding a few tears like the sad boi I am, I immediately started slamming 8.5% beers. I entered my spaceship and did not come back down to earth till about a week ago (literally).

Anyways the dust has cleared and I’ve been able to finally be sober more or less (some herb in there of course I’m unemployed lol) and I’ve been getting bored... I live alone too so there’s only so much wanking a 30+ year old man can do.

So because I got fired for extensive absences I can’t collect unemployment. I’ve already tried a few times now and they keep denying my claim. That means I got to find work and I need to find it fast. I can float myself for a few months, maybe three but after that I’m going to have to slang this smelly disgusting ass to make ends meet. (This is why you don’t get fired from jobs you need kids!)

I’ve been applying to a fair amount of jobs and getting responses. I’m an attorney but a scrub in the field. I’ve been able to skirt through two interviews without saying much about the termination but I just had an interview yesterday that straight up called me out for being evasive since i didn’t want to give them the full reason I was fired. Because of covid this has actually been an email interview, that’s right an email interview... supposedly this firm has a three part interview process and the last one is the virtual face to face so it’s not like I can just blabber out an excuse and squeak by like I have with the other two.

Any of you fuckers have experience getting fired and then explaining what happened in your next interview with any success? Obviously you aren’t going to bring up the being a drunk part but I’m talking more about the fallout. O and for the record I’m not asking how to avoid it (although that would be nice) but just how to deal with it. 

I knew it was going to be a big deal but didn’t think it would be this much of a big deal. Guess I just gotta try with the smaller firms for now.

So what is the cheapest alcohol in your country?,17,lh586j,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lh586j/so_what_is_the_cheapest_alcohol_in_your_country/,108,"I live in the UK and the cheapest I have found is without a doubt is Taurus cider, an amazing £1.85 for 4x500ml 5%abv cans. (£1.95 if you want it in pear or berries flavour). Pretty much all cheap drink is cider, vodka is very expensive in this country, a 70cl bottle will cost you at least £11. Even beer is quite expensive, I remember the days when alcoholics would drink Special Brew and Kestrel Super, but now those are about £8 a pack.

A few other strong contenders would be - 

Frosty Jacks Cider - £4.45, 4x500ml 7.5%abv cans

Tescos/Morrisons/Sainsburys Cider - £2.20 4x500mlc 5%abv cans

Crumpton Oaks Cider £2.05 1x2L 5% bottle

Woke up at 6am today took a shot. Threw up a bunch. Smoked a bit of pot to try to help my stomach and watched videos for a few hours. Threw up again. Had 2 more  swigs and faded in and out of consciousness to night terrors and hallucinations, all felt extremely real. Like perfectly on point with your life, fears, and insecurities.

Had to call my girlfriend to make sure it wasn't real. Took another shot promised I would stay awake because I was horrified of nodding in and out again. The voices I can deal with but these night terrors were something else. As i'm nursing vodka mixed with water I fall asleep again, but I would be seeing stuff in my room and shit. This one was even worse. Sheer unadulterated terror. when I awoke only to the realization that, it was all bullshit, my heart started pounding.

My eyes feel heavy but i'm fighting consciousness  and trying to return to normal. Things are getting rough again, to think I had a month sober 3 months ago, funny shit.

BLOOD

I screamed. I was so taken aback. The toilet bowl turns red. So I call the doctor.

I go to reach up and touch it, and just excruciating pain in my arm and shoulder. I figure I’m concussed and I try and stay up. I go to the doctor the next day.

I have a broken collar bone at the shoulder joint and a torn ligament. As we speak my left side is a huge bruise. Can’t move it without pain, breathing deep sucks.

My house is warm. There’s Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Showtime & HBO on the television. Two sweet puppers curled up and snoozing on the bed. Plenty to drink.

Went downstairs & fired up the stove. Lil smokies wrapped in crescent rolls & mac & cheese for breakfast. Cut through the morning phlegm w an icy-cold seltzer.

Knock that back, then pop one to work on while the food cooks. Finish that, then stick two more in the pockets of my sweat-pants and bring the food up to Her, along w a cold Dr. Pepper, which is how she likes to wake up.

Watching *Ramen Girl* and grazing through our meal. 

My feet are cold. No matter what the furnace is dialed to, with weather like this, drafts sneak through every door & window.

It's no use, my mouth is too dry, not only that but my whole body screams after water. Once again I surpress the urge to go out of bed. Because I know exactly well, that once I leave my bed, the anxiety will take me down. So I close my eyes again...

Eyes are open now, did I sleep? The lighting in the room changed slighty, was it an hour, maybe two?    I check my phone. 16 minutes have passed. This exact same scenario repeated about 10-15 times.

After taking all those shots I feel revitalized and get out of bed, only to realize that my no sleep problem will take its toll in the long run.

Our favorite time of the year has arrived. This chick on my facebook posted about how hating valentines day means you're bitter. Like fuck yeah I am. I've had three girlfriends and a boyfriend at 23 and a half. Not bad, but my chances are slimming because I've become even more of an alcoholic asshole since all of those relationships. Last time I got a girls snap on tinder I was honest and told her I drink a good bit. Hasnt talked to me since.. You guys think lying is better?

 I thought at 21 I was unattractive because I was an unemployed loser. Now I make decent money driving a forklift and (mostly) have my shit together. 2020 was a good year for me! Doesn't seem to help my relationship game though. I got pretty tight with one girl last year and she broke the shit out of my heart.

My valentines will be spent with my first love vodka while my friends are doing their cutesy lovey relationship shit. How about you guys?",1612686089
Mom's got cancer,105,lduw1v,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lduw1v/moms_got_cancer/,21,"Mom found a lump in her breast, went and got tested, said she'd phone me with results.  I missed the call; I was sleeping off last night's drinks. So I woke up to a text that said, ""Call me."" & i knew then it was bad news.

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma 

I'm not good with stress, so I started drinking on the video call when i finally got a hold of her. I wonder if her constant worry aout my lifestyle contributed to this. Next thing I knew, I was pretty damn drunk and phoning friends/family i hadn't spoken to in years. Reaching out, I guess

It's 4AM. I dreamed I got stabbed. Awoke to gut wrenching pain. Pissed out of my ass like a fire-hose. Drinking more, & my stomachs feeling better.

Anyways, if you're religious, pray for my mom. Lord knows what kind of bender I'd go on if anything were to happen to her.

Saturday Success Stories,11,le1d64,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/le1d64/saturday_success_stories/,41,"Good Morning (afternoon/evening) CA!

How is everyone doing this fine winter’s morn? It’s Saturday again and the day before the Big Game. [Superbowl Sunday’s tomorrow](https://youtu.be/F35hBt-SZ9w). Who’s watching? I may, I may not. I honestly didn’t really watch much football this season. Frankly, been peeved with the Eagles since they traded Foles. I know that there’s a Philly connection to the game tomorrow in the form of Andy Reid, but ngl... there’s no love lost there. So we’ll see. In the meantime, today is Saturday and you know what that means!


This week hasn’t been super exciting in my world. We got snow early on and then I spent most of the rest with a migraine. Now that I’m feeling a bit better, there’s more snow on the way... fun! In spite of all that, everyone ate, made it to their appointments, and is generally happy. Things could be worse. I got a couple new plants to help brighten up my mood, so that’s fun. Hopefully they survive, because it seems like 30% of all house plants I bring home croak. I wish I could find some African violets. I used to have a bunch of those and always had good luck with them, but with succulents being so popular violets are difficult to find these days. Sad. It’s okay, though. The days are starting to get noticeably longer. Spring is on its way. Soon I will be spending most of my time outside, and my gardens out there will be just bursting with flowers and veggies. God, I can’t wait. Successes are pretty thin on ground otherwise. Nothing major to report. I survived.

How about you beautiful degenerates? How are things in your world? Let’s hear your wins for the week, big or small. Got a new job? Hit a new sober milestone? Found a new level of CA? Tell us all about it!! Lurkers and newbs, we want to hear from you, too! This is the perfect place to introduce yourself! We don’t bite... I promise!

I said from the passengers side of my sisters car “you’re not a bad person, you’re sweet. You’ll be okay.”

I related to her super hard because I used to cry and say that to my mom a bunch for my mistakes...

She stopped crying and walked away. She smiled and the guy subtly nodded that I calmed her down.

ER Adventures with Pancreatitis Boy,48,ld1n5a,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ld1n5a/er_adventures_with_pancreatitis_boy/,26,"Most spry, young, fledgling alcoholics are... stupid. They're not thinking about the future.

Some are smart and realize they're doing serious damage to their liver.

Some are really smart and notice they're also hurting they're heart, lungs, brain and stomach.

But no one in their early 20's is thinking ""Damn, this half a handle and no food a day habit is making me really worried about my...

*pancreas*.""

What the fuck does a pancreas even do? I've looked so much into pancreatitis, but the organ's actual function is still foreign to me. I don't really care to Google it any more.

So anyways, a good friend checks up on me a couple weeks ago and it's a real bad day. My stomach feels like it's full of broken glass. Every time I roll over in bed the glass sloshes around and slices more of my stomach lining. I can't get any alcohol down, nor can I keep any of the other two drugs I'm dependent on (that I take orally) down. Puking every ten minutes or so.

 If you've seen my [last post,](https://old.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/jic7or/officially_a_ca_now_yaaaaay/) you know I've already been to the ER in the last few months. After that experience, I really didn't care to go again. She makes it clear that she thinks I should go, but doesn't think it's ethical to try to force me to.

We end up having some great conversation, since I felt like I was going to die, and that's a great time to just stop giving a fuck and fully let your personality out. After an hour or so, I smarten up realize *oh fuck, I actually kind of am about to die*.

So she speeds me over to the nearest ER. Since I've been there before, the process is much faster. I also tell them I'm withdrawing from not only alcohol, but one of the other drugs I was withdrawing from (it was five in total).

Only twenty minutes of waiting. Slow night, I guess. I puked twice in this time period. 

We get to the room. I keep puking, which sucks because I have to keep taking my mask off and putting it back on for COVID. My friend keeps getting me new puke bags and throwing away the used ones. Like, fuck. I don't deserve this.

Meanwhile, the doctors are doing their typical not-fucking-helping. I feel like [Tim Roth in Reservoir Dogs,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdoz4Yk20mI) shot in the stomach, crying for help while the nurses hum [The Girl from Ipanema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QfXjsoNe4) and discuss how the next room over needs to be cleaned.

I decide: fuck this. Let's actually vocalize how awful I'm feeling.

Glass in the stomach, puking every five minutes, withdrawing from all five drugs now.

So I decide to just start yelling like a woman giving birth. Plenty of loud ""Jesus Christ""s and ""Fuck""s. Weird spaceship noises with my mouth. Whatever the fuck comes to mind. If the nurses and doctors give a shit about not scaring the little girl with the stomach ache in the next room over, they'll get me sedated faster this time.

It worked. Last time was three hours for a tiny amount of Ativan. This time it was only an hour, and they *fucked me right up*. I don't know if my yelling helped, but I like to imagine they were thinking ""quickly, calm the beast!""

They tell me to sleep, but to keep my IV arm stuck out, so I'm sleeping in this awkward half-crucifix position. Naturally, when I fall asleep, I start folding it in. The doctors angrily force my arm back out. *I thought they wanted me to sleep?* Luckily, my friend comes over and gently pulls my arm out for a while. 

In my Ativan haze, I come to a couple of times. One time I overhear one doctor tell another ""Oh yeah, he's definitely got pancreatitis"". 

The next time, they notice I'm awake, and ask me if I've written a will. 

With the Ativan flowing as hard as it was, I failed to grasp the significance of this question until days later.

They end up moving me to another room. A shared room. *Fuck.* My friend is still there watching me, even though I've been here several hours now, mostly sleeping. I don't remember much of what happened, other than realizing **I lost my fucking vape**.

No nicotine in here? No way. I start looking around for it a little... too obviously. A nurse notices and asks what I'm looking for. She holds up my bright yellow Maxpod, which is [obviously an e-cigarette.](https://www.freemaxvape.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maxpod-kit-yellow.png)

She asks me if it's mine, I say yes. She asks me what it is, and I say

*... a ticket?*

Somehow, she sees through my brilliant explanation. 

""There is to be no smoking in the hospital!"" She exclaimed, stressing every consonant in the most irritating way possible. 

My friend says she's about to go home and that she'll take it. *Thank god*.

They wheel me into another room... I think? The doctor sticks another IV in me and tells me he's going to be giving me a drug that started with an M. It wasn't Midazolam, it had to do with stem cells, or pineal glands, or some other weird brain shit. I'm a drug nerd, but I've never heard of it. The name took my friend by surprise too.

This shit was fucked. I was so fucked up in this hospital. I have no idea what they gave me. The doctor comes over and tells me they're going to have me admitted for treatment.

I yell at him ""No! I'm going to leave!""

But I actually didn't.

I calmly said ""Nah, I think I'm just going to go"".

I didn't do that either. I just thought it very loudly. But for the next ten minutes, I was certain I told him I was leaving.

The doctors are all on the other side of the room, discussing how they're going to save my life. A nurse comes up to me, holds up the tube connected to my arm and says 

""This is for you!""

Whether they thought I was staying or going, I didn't know. But I did know that what this woman was saying was fucking bewildering. 

I start looking at that coat-hanger with a drug baggie hanging off of it, thinking *they want me to take it home with me?*

The logistics of fitting this in the car while it's still attached to me are far too complex.

Then I think, *maybe she just meant the end part where the IV is connected? Like a souvenir?*

But the logistics of separating just that are also complicated.

In a stroke of genius, I decide to *rrrrrrrrriipp* the IV out of my arm.

Blood goes everywhere. All over my pants, my hospital gown, the floor, my shoes, my arm. One of the two doctors goes into the [surrender cobra](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151212170138-01-surrencer-cobra.jpg) position and starts walking over saying something like ""What the hell are you doing!?""

This scared super high me. I realized I did something wrong, and tried my best to remedy it for them.

I began stabbing the shit out of my arm trying to get the IV back in.

Now both doctors are in surrender cobra sprinting over to me. The nurse pulls my arm out and immediately dresses it. Again, in a half-crucifix position.

I don't know if this is exactly what happened next, but this is how I remember it.

The head doctor comes over to me and asks what's up. I tell him I'm leaving, but for real this time. He gets down on one knee and gives a killer monologue.

""Son, when I took this job, I made an oath. An oath that I wouldn't let anyone get hurt. If I let you leave, I'm letting you get hurt, and I'm breaking that oath. And that means a lot to me.

... but, I can't legally just keep you here"".

So, obviously, I tell him I'm dipping.

My friend has stayed with me for numerous hours at this point, so I get my shit and leave real quickly.

Que me, stumbling through the hospital on whatever-the-fuck they gave me, covered in blood, following my friend. I'm about 8 feet behind her since I can't walk very fast. *What a great look*.

She goes to get her car to pull it up front. I make my way to the lobby, which feels like an immaculate palace. It was really just a shitty hospital lobby with high ceilings. 

I'm stumbling all over this ramp trying to make it down without faceplanting. Two old ladies with walkers are coming up it. ""Do you need any help young man?""

*I'm supposed to be helping them up the ramp. How the tables turn.*

My friend eventually pulls up, and, of course, we hit a gas station to buy some beer.

I head in and throw my 12-pack up on the counter. Still covered in blood. The cashier looks at my ID, looks me up and down and says, ""Shit, you look like a baby!""

No mention of the blood though, cool.

We go home, have some beer, smoke some weed, and chill out. I remember almost none of this, but I think it was a good time.

Since all of this happened, I've gone from 10-11 drinks (as an extremely underweight person) a day to 3. Going to hit 2 and then hop off and drink a fuck ton of chamomile tea and smoke weed. My pancreas feels much better now. 

I'm gonna miss the debauchery, but fuck getting that again. I hope you enjoyed this long ass shit. Chairs",1612537024

I’ve been throwing up in the same plastic bag by my bed for days. 

At least I have you guys. I love this subreddit. If it weren’t for y’all I would be calling people up or getting myself cancelled on Twitter. 

So, today I woke up feeling sickly. Threw up. Went back to sleep. Woke up again, spewed some more. After spewing a bit more, I was sobered up and decided to hit Zaxbys. I don’t know why that was my choice, but some chicken tendies and texas toast seemed like the motherfucking jam. And it was. 

Decided to stop by the liquor store on my way back. Ate a tendie in the parking lot, before entering the store. Snagged a fifth of gin even though I’ve been on the vodka. 

I finished the zaxbys when I got home. It nurtured me back to life somewhat. I don’t even know how I made it out the house, but thank god I did.

It passed. Back to “normal” for a few days. Then this past Sunday, it came back again. Only it’s not going away this time. A few drinks does make it subside, which made me think it’s withdrawal, but it comes back literally an hour after my last drink so it couldn’t possibly be withdrawal.

I'm not a burden, I own my own home, I work a job which I've started making decently good money this year. But I drink, and I'm not a fun drunk. I wish I could just stop. I'm 34 years old. 

I actually wanted to attempt a sober month this February. Unfortunately my fathers death anniversary was two days ago. I'm in a super sad funk, so I drank. I haven't been eating (covid also gifted me 40 lbs this year) and dinner got screwed so I made a drink instead because drinking makes the hunger go away.

I dunno (from the animal porn guy),17,lcet0n,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/lcet0n/i_dunno_from_the_animal_porn_guy/,10,"So i went to a new shrink this week. They aint cheap. I got a steady job now if i can keep it. so i saved a pretty penny and bought this guy. Last one didnt work. New one looks exactly like sigmund freud.  so four hundred dollars later i pour my soul into his lap as he scratches into a notepad and i wonder if he wants to fuck his mother. He tells me here's some pills why dont yer fuckin take them!

When i was younger i thought i was indestructible. Life is wasted on the young. Im 32 .  I get it. thats young. But the last psych i saw got me to agree to a questionnaire gave me an entrance level dose of SSRI's and Dexamphetamine and i had a stroke maybe two months later. I had a conversation with old lasty you see. I asked him; Do i get to opt out of this? if you make me into someone i don't want to be can i change it back? He said well im a doctor take yer fuckin pills.

So i took them fuckin pills. And i had a stroke. On the day I had 2 scotches. 3 dexy. 1 citalopram. didnt say nothing about not drinking. Somewhere in the alembic of that mix i nearly died. It happened between some guys wife's thighs. the husband  was jacking it in the corner watching me and two other guys fuck her. My right arm was like a steak sticky taped to my shoulder. Flapping around like meat. Couldn't say anything was wrong. Didn't understand anything was wrong. tried my best to finsih the act but try impress a girl with your noodle when your bleeding out in your [brain.one](https://brain.one) of the otrher guys took me to the hospital. Took me maybe a week to stop completely drooling and about 6 months to fully recover.

So like symptoms of ssris right, if you misdiagnose brain nonsense with this shit is excessive horniness.  And I've fucked people right because who doesnt like to party? But not to the extent that i seek out cucks. She was cute! Not worth dying over, but as deaths go there could be way worse ways to go. Think about getting old? Fuck going as a sad mouldy peach somewhere in a nursing home. This is turning into a piss streak of hypochondria. But my point is I've met death. I'm none to keen on meeting it again.

So my new psych hes like why dont you take these pills? And i bought them. Theyre next to my door. I walk past em every day on the way out to work. And i ask myself am i walking past my death? This cunt don't give a shit about me. He read off a questionnaire when I asked why am I me? You cant buy friends but at 400 bucks at least give me some empathy. Instead he sold me another spin at the roulette wheel of psychiatric medical science.

Im fucking lazy but i feel like I got 1 book in me. If im gonna die soon i gotta get it outta me pronto. But i cant just write it. I feel all humanity is is a domesticated animal that society tamed. i wanna catch that idea and put it in a bottle. I have to illustrate that shit. Like rena and stimpy crossed with dragon ball kinda shit. Maybe some avatar the last airbender too.  Im working on furry porn atm because what i have in mind requires articulation of like where your body is when you attack someone in my style in whatever context that comes up. A drunken judo manual if you will.

If you know me you know me as the drunken judoka. ive come up with a style of judo that is hideous as piss. That shouldnt exist. That is the manisfestation of my soul.  It takes a level of core strength that unless you maintain it daily you cant do it. I cant do it anymore. My means of expressing myself unto a horrified world, that has left me. But if i learn to draw maybe i can put it onto paper. A style of fighting that is a question and not an answer. A curiosity as you test you opponents limits and probe their soul.

Eating good food is delightful. When you're drunk, it's really quite euphoric. When you're like me and you can't stop doing anything you get into, then you're going to drink and drink, and then eat and eat, until you pass out - which results in gaining a ton of weight. Especially since the days following these binges there's not much energy to really do much. Also, right now we are in a pandemic which further demotivates getting out.

Realized yesterday, she meant it this time. ""I have nothing to say to you"" Awesome. You shouldn't get whiskey dick with a girl of her caliber, I suppose. Not even once.  I have spent every waking thought on her since we met. She was a bartender. Of course. Married. Fucking beautiful. More than I could have ever wished for. Free booze, snuck me shots. Then amazing sex in cars, or hotel rooms. three times a week. As fucked up as it is to have over a year long affair, when her husband caught us after 3 months.. she was my world. I really fucking loved her. And now she gets to run right back to the arms of her husband, and I have nothing. I got fired 2 months ago. For voicing concerns that my boss was micro-managing me, and I was pretty convinced he had a coloring book that he should finish first. Been living in a hotel that I haven't paid for in over a month. Lost my phone. the clutch burned out in my truck. My current routine is... hustle up enough money to forget how miserable my life is every day. People trust me with money. I made more than both of my parents combined per hour. Still couldn't manage to give a fuck.  I was pretty functional for a while. If drinking 20-30 beers and eventually showing up to work is functional. I got shitwrecked last night, as usual.  Made things worse with my girl. Because I'm fucking smooth like that. Woke up at 6:00 a.m to down all the alcohol that remained. took a little nappy-nap. Limped my busted ass truck at 20 mph to the liquor store with a parade of pissed off cars behind me, after borrowing ten dollars for another fifth of that vodka they prop the bottom shelves up with. Pouring it in a dirty styrofoam cup that I half-ass rinsed out.  Chasing it with orange juice makes it healthy, right? Here's to hopefully never feeling a goddamned thing again.

The TLDR is that my guy came through with a 12 pack at 5:30 a.m. on a Monday mornin.

Short story long: I awoke needing the Devil's elixir in no short fashion and swiftly drove to town to attain Grand Dad's cough medicine so I wouldn't get sick (late Sundy night). I typically drink a bottle a day. If you have to ask how big the bottle is you must be new here. Much to my dismay I forgot that it was ***fucking Sunday in God's country*** which meant the sauce was not on the menu. Apparently it's bad or something. I dunno. Bible Belt Life...

I instead grabbed a Baconator and headed home- to my bar that's my fuckin home. I occasionally bring food there and then commence drinking copious amounts of alcohol. It's cool- they know me there. Well, due to the current Covid situation everyone is closing at 11 p.m.. This meant I had time for a couple drinks ***or*** my food. You know how this went. A good time was had and I arrived at my domicile to eat my cow.

After finishing my cow/pig conglomerate I decided I needed more of Satan's sweat so I went to the casino that I can literally see from my front porch because they serve until 1 a.m.. - it was now after midnight. I hustled the hottie behind the bar into serving me 3 heavy drinks in only 30 minutes and retreated to my basement, only to crave more because I wasn't *there* yet. Well, being the piece o' shit that I am I decided to text a couple friends of mine to ask of they had anything I could buy off of them. One answered hours later.

This guy may as well be my fuckin brother. I'd kill for him. He'd kill for me. The first time I met him was at said bar and we were the only two patrons to be seen. He was at a pool table and the bartender was up his ass. I figured I'd approach him since we had her in common (I'd done seen her nekked so I figured ""why not?""). Turns out they've known each other their whole lives, so on, so forth, failed relationship and whatnot. Fast forward to me passing out on his couch. I awoke to a folding table with an alarm clock set to the right time, and 2 alarms to give me enough time to get home and shower before work. There was also 2 McDonald's breakfast sandwiches and an OJ. **This guy just outdid 99% of my previous friends**. (Some of which I was arrested with)

This morning (Today) was the 2nd time in 7 years that I've asked him for booze because I was out. He's never been addicted to anything and is actually curious about it- he literally wants to know *why* I struggle with liquor and pills. He just wants to understand where I'm comin from. He may not ""get it"" but he ""gets it"" enough to know when I need help. My man kept me from gettin sick and I couldn't thank him enough. I bought what he had at his house, he went to work, and I'm now at home drinkin. Danny, you're a fuckin legend bro.",1612211958

(I deleted the post but a bunch of you reached out and I appreciate that)

Back to pouring pints in my water container at work.   And though a pint isn't enough to make me feel much of anything, I drive home like the irresponsible degenerate that i am.

Called in today there was no way. 

Typical day yesterday. Better than typical, actually. No dry heaves or real WD. Must've still been drunk when I woke up around 4 a.m. snuck out of bed as to not wake up the boyfriend and force myself to choke down the days first drink to level out.

I love that phrase. ""Level out"". My brother's make fun of me because I say that so often. They don't understand, but I'm sure you do.

Leveling out is always the intention when I force that first drink down. I just need to feel better and then I can quit. HAHAHA. Yeah right. Once I feel a bit better, I'm no longer content just being leveled out. Im getting drunk. 

You guys know the drill. Rinse, repeat. Every. Fucking. Day. 

Anyway. Im usually pretty good about making sure I have something for the morning. But apparently not last night. ""You dumb, dumb bitch.."" on repeat in my brain as I'm desperately trying to pour some water in the wild Turkey bottle to get that last tiny bit out.

Here's the real kicker. I'm at my boyfriend's house. He lives in fucking kansas. No liquor sales until noon on Sunday. 

What's a girl to do?

It was a struggle to even put clothes on. You can forget about brushing my teeth or even remotely trying to disguise the fact that I'm sweating out whiskey. I can smell myself. Its not good. 

Get in the car and make the drive across state line to Missouri. 

Only bought a 750 so I can maybe attempt another taper situation. Had my bf hide some away just in case I end up plowing through it in an hour like usual.

I'm only 30. Im going to die soon. I'm fully aware of this fact but like I said. What's a girl to do?

Meaning I peed the bed. Now I always laughed at you fuckers when I read your posts. Meandering to myself, thank god I don't do that. Nope looks like somewhere inside my broken mind, I am supressing deep rooted psychological issues that have manifested itself outwards and onto my sheets. Or its because I switched over to wine and beer. Either way, Its cool, I don't like this bed, or myself very much. 

 Now normally It wouldn't be an issue, other than celebrating a new chapter and title (piss sleeper). However I recently left my ex and rekindled with an old flame. Well we haven't been together since 2012. It never worked out because we lacked wisdom & engaged in unbridled passions, awalt & I lost all frame and got caught up in jackassery. Things change.

 We always were & still are very much alike, kindred souls. A muse, a friend and a lover, essentially my other half. Ect ect. You get it, I've forever pined for this wild and amazing bitch, and she was there to celebrate my first. Wow what a great start. 

 I left my ex, a literal MD Physician just so I can have another chase after true love, I miss the luxury. I don't miss the the bore, the monotony of existing as delicious arm candy and house carl. I will say, I am appreciative of the reprivial of alcoholism. I did engage in sobriety for the longest spell. But In the end, I simply cherish my individualism moreso than wealth. I am a simple person. 

 Currently, I am inspired by this maddness, by my own passions of life, I know I'll probably fuck it up because ultimately I chose alcohol over everything, also because dark empathy. Granted she is fully aware of my love for the drink and is willing to engage into a thruple, but I am selfaware and know I should nip this in the bud now and burn it all down, to spare her from me. Or maybe I'm just being melodramatic, fractious in insecure fear, mabey I just need to stfu & enjoy this vibration for now, I'll have my own ever after.

QEPD, Jeff. He was a good man. Not a CA, but he worked in the bar industry for many years (not how I met him, surprisingly), and he cared about CAs a great deal. I watched him mourn more than one regular. He had a huge heart, and he raised a good kid, and he tried to leave the world better than he found it.

Lessons from the legends,79,l7levm,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l7levm/lessons_from_the_legends/,38,"I recently learned some lessons from drinking legends. 

You see, I come from a tiny community of \~150 people in the Canadian prairies where the motto is work hard, drink harder. Everyone is at least a FA and we get our fair share of CA who drink themselves to death or commit suicide.

Anyway, I have been thinking about the lessons learned from some really hardcore drinkers that still managed to lived into their 70s or 80s, which isn't uncommon where I'm from. Anyway, the lessons. 

&#x200B;

1. Stick to beer or really weak mixed drinks monday to friday, (keep it to after work as much as you can)
2.  On the weekends, drink beer or beer-strength mixed drinks steadily and quickly while shooting some good liquor on the side for the buzz.
3. Find good quality food to eat that your ancestors ate, many men around here have ukrainian and hungarian heritage so they eat good homemade sausage, pickles, pickled carrots & beans, cabbage rolls, cheese, etc when drinking, kind of like the russians with their appetizers and bread when they shoot vodka
4. Keep moving, lots of these guys are farmers or trades workers who move around a lot despite their drinking/hangover out of sheer willpower
5. Have fucking fun! Party hard with your buds, talk to people, buy rounds and enjoy it, you're gonna die one day anyway and your sure as fuck want people remembering how fun you were to party with ( trust me, guys who are fun to party with have the dopest funerals)
6. Do your best to care for those around you. You may be a drunk bastard, but even the most fucked up addict needs support sometimes, and sometimes family/friends are all that keep you afloat.
7. Don't feel judged. You can have no addictions  but still be depressed and kill yourself. You could be injectng meth in a back alley. Some teetolers athletes get cancer and die at 35, some alcoholics live to 87, don't sweat it and be yourself. Anyone who judges you could be hit by god or karma and die while you'll drink over their grave.",1611930304

Drinking & driving finally took its toll / Beer run gone bad,0,l7jf4o,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l7jf4o/drinking_driving_finally_took_its_toll_beer_run/,30,"Last Friday after my last night shift I started the usual - drinking beers until I pass out. When I woke up I continued where I left off. I have the most anger issues with alcohol when I am drinking on an empty stomach, it literally turns me into a demon, but I still do it sometimes, for some reason. So I went through all my beers and a couple benzos, then looked at the clock - it was around 10pm. Shit. In my state you can’t buy alcohol between 9pm - 7am anywhere except in bars, which are ofcourse closed thanks to Covid.
Then in my drunken-benzo rage I came to the genius idea to go get alcohol from a neighbouring state (it’s about 30km away on a freeway - it’s the same state where I also work). So I drink the last beer, take another xanax for good measure & go on my way, despite my girlfriend telling me I shouldn’t go. 

Well I didn’t make it to the freeway - I slept in behind the wheel at the bypass at around 90km/h. Everything there is a blur, I remember the crash and being spun and then landing at the other side of the road. I get out of the car, see that it’s trashed, throw the license plates into the nearby forest, take out the traffic permit and make a run for it to the nearby bus station, where i called the taxi to bring me back home. Of course I don’t feel any pain yet, because of the shock/adrenaline.
The next 2 days were hell, I couldn’t move my head an inch, thank god my girl was there for me, otherwise I wouldn’t know what to do. 

So then comes monday, I call my boss and tell him what hapened and that I can’t come to work (I told him my friend was driving not me) & go to the hospital later on Tuesday. I went to be treated into this neighbouring state of mine (yes the same state I wanted to go get beers there at the gas station), since I work there and it’s easier with sick days (the states speak different languages). 
Diagnose: Cervical verterba broken. Shit. They said I was unbelievably lucky to have lived through that. At least I wore my seat belt! The airbags didn’t even go off, old car and all that. 
Anyway I had surgery done yesterday & all went well, thank god. I need to stay in till Monday & then hopefully I can go home.

Moral of the story: I guess it had to happen someday. I’m positive I slept in only because of the xans, because I’m too used to drinking & driving, but yeah, it had to happen. Thank god I didn’t harm anyone in my drunken escapades but myself. This was a serious wake up call.

Edit: Promised edit

   I been having a breakdown again lately because things were just 1 step forward 2 back for so long, especially feeling lonely. And last week I asked this super pretty girl (who I actually do like) to go hiking with me, and she said yes, but I said let’s do it next Saturday (8 days away).

    Massive anxiety either way over that, but especially 8 days man. It’s just too fucking long. Anxiety alone would kill it for her if she’s anxious like me, let alone with so many men hitting on her, it has to feel silly to wait 8 days to see me.

   I’m just a) so goddamn busy I cannot meet up with her any sooner and b ) okay reality check I spend 10-15 hours a week drinking alone which is both weird lol and gets in the way of even making plans with this girl.

   We’ve never been close or anything-I literally avoided her because she’s so pretty-but have definitely found one another attractive and run in the same circle of people for a long time. So I’m gonna be kinda fuckin sad if we don’t at least get a chance to go on a date 😂

   She just texted me saying maybe she has to cancel. 110% I think it’s a text, and either she’s seeking reassurance, or testing my resolve, or both. Plus some unknowns lol, women have never had the benefit of simplicity.

   Just I guess please comment of message me. I’m here. I’ll be real. If you rip on me I will 100% listen if you try to listen back. I know I’m clueless but fuck it. I just landed a good job and almost a date with a really cool girl. I’m wide open man.

I was a kid, probably 8 or 9, and we went on vacation to visit my little brothers side of the family. Real country folk.

Lived out in the middle of nowhere, and I have no idea why his dad thought we'd want to go, except for the zoo.

They had a ""private"" zoo. Everyone in that small ass town would go and visit at least once, supposedly. They had all sorts of odd animals and no real answer about how they got them.

Peacocks, armadillos, deer, chickens, those are what I really remember because they would roam the property freely. But Gypsy was special. Gypsy had to be caged.

I was told not to go near the cage, so naturally, that's where I went as soon as the adults weren't around. It stank like decay. They'd realized they couldn't afford to keep buying her meat because, well, she ate a lot. So they would slaughter the occasional deer and feed it to her.

So, I see this big beautiful cat, in a small ass pen, whole thing soaked in blood, with bones lying all around, and everyone telling me to stay the fuck away from her, I did the only reasonable thing. I sat out there every moment I got and watched her. She watched me back. Pure muscle and anger. But gorgeous. 

One day, she got comfortable with me being there and laid down to nap. Looking back, I actually don't think she was really napping, but my dumbass thought she was, so I got closer. Eventually, I was close enough. I could reach through the bars. So, I did. And I got to pet her, for maybe all of 3 seconds, before she jerked up and tried to eat my damn arm off.

Idk, that's like the story of my life. I know it's stupid. I know I shouldn't, everyone tells me not to do something. But I can't seem to stop myself. I'm basically a really lucky idiot.

But, I got to pet a mountain lion. And I got to do a lot of stupid shit throughout my life that I probably shouldn't have. Probably shouldn't keep drinking, but yet again, the more I shouldn't, seems like I just end up more enticed by the idea.

I hate my stupid brain. But, I think I'm in love with being stupid. That other post about AA phrases made me think of this. Til jails, institutions, or death do us part.",1611609750

My sister and I drove back to our respective homes around four and I didn’t think I was gonna make it. First thing I did after dropping her off was run to the liquor store.

I decided to compile a list of AA sayings and add their subliminal CA meanings. For no other reason except that I'm in the middle of a blackout bender (although I'm admitting it's a blackout, so maybe it actually isn't?). I hope you all enjoy! 

""One day at a time"" - Don't go planning your fucking future while drunk. Sober you wants very different things than drunk you. Sober you is also capable of far less than drunk you thinks. FAR LESS. Remember that. 

""Easy does it"" -  No need to chug. The alcohol isn't gonna run away. Less chance of ending up blacked out, vomiting and dead if you take your time. Avoiding death is key. 

""Work the steps"" - When walking on stairs whilst intoxicated, make sure you feel the step with your foot before putting your weight on it. Less tumbles this way, which means less bruises and less speculations of domestic violence. 

""Progress, not perfection"" - Set the bar low. Instead of being mad that you didn't hit your goal of zero drinks today, be proud of the fact that you only had 17 instead of your standard 20 in a day. 
*Alternate meaning* - Taper!! Be safe. 20-15-10-5-0 is phenomenal and far better than going cold turkey if you're dependent. Not that this is new information. 

""If nothing changes, nothing changes"" - Your sheets smell like a gym sock because you haven't changed them since last summer. Your shirt smells like gym socks because you drink when you should be doing laundry. And your gym socks don't smell like gym socks because you don't exercise or engage in physical exertion beyond running from the police and walking to the offsale.",1611542450

I’m also curious if people even bother with covid dating or not? I’ve definitely tried but in Los Angeles it’s a mixed bag on that one.

At todays' appointment, we learned he has 3 Kpin prescriptions which date back to the 1990s, and as far as records show he has been taking all three for at least a decade.  And honestly, probably 20+ years. Total is 17MG per day.  


  
 Oh.... those 1990's doctors were fun as shit/absolutely insane.    


To this day, he also has a 40MG Oxy script that the doctors eventually decided was simply too much to cut/wean him from (thank god), and decided they would just write it to his death.

Flies in your drink.,54,l2x6ub,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l2x6ub/flies_in_your_drink/,29,"
Early morning wake up again. No alcohol in the house. Stupid, fucking stupid. I play this game every night where I tell myself I should go to the store so I have plenty of booze for the next day and don't have to do the early morning walk, but always end up putting it off until I eventually pass out. *It's not too bad*, I tell myself, *only an hour and a bit till the store opens again*. I figure I'd just sup some water (which my body probably badly needs anyway) until the store opens. Maybe I was already withdrawing and my perception of time was fucked but my God that felt like the longest hour *ever*, as I constantly looked at my watch and asked myself if I set off then would I get there in time for them to be able to sell. I felt like I'd just watched a slew of YouTube videos and only a few minutes had passed after a marathon.

So it finally gets to serving time and I suit up and head out on my early morning trek. It's cold out. I know there's places that have snow on the ground and this isn't one of them, but I fucking hate the cold and it bites into my frame. Should have worn a hoodie under my jacket but I'm too far along the journey to turn back and get one now. Mexican Comedian is serving at the store. I idly wonder if he'll ask me for ID. He must have seen me coming in here every day, and they're zealous about carding everyone but he barely glances at me he rings my stuff through. Probably saw me as I walked through the doors and thought ""this fucking guy again.""

The walk home is torture. I get struck by that weird time dilation again and it feels like the walk is taking forever when in reality it's only around ten minutes. I start coughing and I dread what's coming: I end up spewing. Like, I'm practically bent double, one hand on a tree in someone's front yard, just fucking heaving up streams of bile. Like, what the fuck, body? I haven't even had any alcohol yet! I worry about puking again and some cop or 'concerned citizen' driving by and seeing me. It's 6 in the morning; you see some guy puking in someone's front yard, dressed like a hobo, you're probably thinking crackwhore or something. I peel down side streets to discreetly finish the walk back and up spewing a couple more times.

I get home and enjoy the fruit of my labor, albeit puking after half of the first beer. There's these little flies buzzing everywhere, they're like gnats or little flies or something. There's a mountain of empties stacked neatly on my computer desk and they're flitting from the opening of each can or bottle. They'll swarm in my face and fly into my mouth or nose. So annoying. Did they spawn from the beer or something?

I think I've built up a tolerance to the beer. I was dimly aware I've now gone past the time limit of the benders I'd been on last year. They usually ended around the two week point, but it's been around a month now. A month of just getting blasted every day, my existence reduced to drinking until I pass out, waking up and repeating the cycle again. The beer obviously isn't cutting it anymore; I notice mild shaking despite the fact I'm halfway through a pack, I'm severely depressed and on edge. I look forward more to drinking the shooters I buy. I briefly panicked the other day because I was worried I'd run out of mixer for my drinks. Miracle of miracles I discovered a bottle of Martinelli on top of the bridge that CA Ex Girlfriend had bought, and I'd just obliviously missed it every time I searched for a mixer. 

So I decide to drink the two shooters I'd gotten early, as a little pick me up treat. I feel better after I drink them whereas before they used to knock me out, as an endcap to a day of drinking beer. There aren't really any clean vessels around; I'd puked in a lot of them and they're either still filled with spew or full of water for when I planned to never get around to washing them. I espy a clean mug and absentmindedly snatch it up to make a mixer. Turns out of be a gift I'd bought for CA Ex Girlfriend that I'd forgotten about. It has a poem about me appreciating her butt and a cartoon of both of us on it. I thought it was cute, I like to buy personalized gifts for people like that. She forgot about it the week after I gave it to her. Figures. I haven't heard anything more from her after she moved to San Diego. I don't think I will. She already has her cover story that she's a poor little victim who 'escaped' an abusive relationship and she'll milk it for all the sympathy she can get.

I decide to try and make the shooters stretch so after I drink the first mixer I switch back to beer but I'm starting to find the taste rancid and I'm not really getting that same buzz anymore. After I force myself to chug the last of a beer I think fuck it, pick up the mug and head into the kitchen to make another mixer. I'm about to pour the drink in when I notice the mug is full of squirming *things*, wriggling around in the rapidly melting ice cubes. I wonder if I'm hallucinating for a moment and peer closer. It's those gnat-things from my stack of empties. Fuckers divebombed the bottom of my mug to get the last dregs of that sweet vodka and apple juice. I threw the swill down the drain, rinsed out the mug and myself another mixer. 

After I finished that I thought I'd switch it up and try drinking ice cold beer, so I washed out a glass that was previously used as a puke receptacle and fill it with ice cubes. Still tastes like shit, but I think ice cold beer is marginally better than room temperature/lukewarm beer. I go out for a cigarette to relieve the tedium. Construction noises coming from the apartment next door; they've only been working on the place since October last year. I come back inside to swig the last of my beer and crack open a new one but as I bring the glass up to my face I see more dying gnats swimming around in my drink. Goddammit. 
 
I think I've accepted I'm heading for homelessness again. Came home from a beer run one time to find a letter from the power company saying they were going to cut me off because CA Ex Girlfriend reversed the last charge they made to her. Great. I've sometimes sat and wondered at night if the power would suddenly go out and that was it, done. Sat in the dark, drinking with my cat. 

The job hunt was a complete and abysmal failure - admittedly mainly due to me going back to hardcore mode when CA Ex Girlfriend came back to Arizona - the few responses I've gotten back have all been ""we've chosen not to continue with your application..."". I thought the next round of stimulus checks were going to come through in time to save us all but it looks like that's not going to happen, and it's too late for me to even get a job now where I have enough money to pay the rent and bills by the 1st. So I think I'm just going to enjoy the time left I have with a roof over my head, power for my laptop, and booze while I can.

I'm an attorney and I'm about to be 33. I drink about 1.5 handles every two days. Just mid-shelf vodka mixed with something, usually a diet soda of some sort, maybe something fancier occasionally. Sometimes if I'm out socially I'll get more expensive shit, especially when someone else is paying, but on my own, always vodka.

I've been doing this since I was 24, through law school, and while working some pretty high ""prestige"" jobs. I was a law clerk at both a federal district court and a federal appeals court (these are fairly difficult jobs to get) and I currently practice constitutional law at a civil rights organization whose/which name you definitely know. Shit is extremely laid back in this world. I just do my work whenever I do it and so long as I do that nobody cares when I'm working. Court deadlines matter but that's it, everything else is flexible. There's not a lot of oversight. I can do whatever the fuck I want when I want mostly. Zoom court is great. I love it. Jacket, shirt, no pants, super easy, super casual.

The thing is I almost never drink during the work day. I do my drinking after work hours--maybe 5:30, 6 PM, til I pass out around 12-2 AM. I get up somewhere around 9-10. So I take down that 3/4 of a handle in about 6-8 hours and then go to sleep. I'm usually OK by the time I wake up. For whatever reason this is the last frontier for me. I refuse to let myself start drinking while working. Well, that's not entirely true. I do sometimes start drinking in the evening if I'm still working on something and I know I don't need my full brain capacity to do whatever I'm doing. But it's rare.

As I age this shit is getting less sustainable. I've had several incidents having to lie in the shower under the running water for hours during the night as I dry heave bile and want to die. Every time I say it's the last time but it never is. But that's the worst of it so far. I guess it can only get worse from here, lol.

Anyway this all sounds like a bunch of bullshit I'm sure. But it's true. As far as I know nobody around me knows I drink like this. I had a sort of breakdown about it when I was taking the bar exam--I had incredible anxiety, I was sure I'd fail, I was drunk for 80% of the time I was meant to be studying, but I passed with flying colors. I almost cancelled my reservation and I did sort of obliquely mention my drinking to my mom. But she's maybe the only person in the world who's close enough to me to know I drink and I know she's in enormous denial about it. And while I'm sure it's obvious I have a huge tolerance when I go out with people I do 99.9% of my drinking alone. Plus, in law, everyone has a high tolerance. We're all alcoholics, in medical terms anyways. The quarantine makes it all even easier. I do sometimes wonder what I could have accomplished if I wasn't drunk 50% of the time. I wonder when my brain is going to give out. I've gone sober for a month here or there but I don't think I've had a sober day in at least 5 years at this point.

I've lost the thread here. There's no point to this post. I'm just rambling. But that's what half the shit in CA is. I've never told anyone in my real life this shit.",1611222052
After work withdrawls,145,l1h051,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l1h051/after_work_withdrawls/,31,"I got back into alcoholism after I divorced my wife.

It was a bit of a trial at first because I had been sober for about a year. But I got back into being drunk sort of quickly. But not so quickly that I was able to manage my withdraws all that efficiently. At first.

You see, and I know you know, I'm sure. You need to know how to manage your own blood alcohol levels. Right? I know you know that. You do, right? 

When I started CA drinking again, after my divorce from my never drinking again ex-wife, I swore 'No drinking before work!'

How long do you think that lasted?

You know how long that lasted.

I woke up one morning at seven in the morning. Had to be at work at 1 pm. 

No drink, because I don't drink before work anymore.

At about three o'clock I'lm shaking. At four I'm retching and trying to hide the fact that I'm convulsing. About to spew up whatever is in my stomach. At five I've got the fever and can feel the creature leaving my body. Still about to spew at any moment. 

I work at a grocery store. We sell beer and wine and spirits. 

I buy a can of Voodoo Ranger, 9% ABV.

Drink it on the way home.

The way home is a nice walk with 9% beer. There are rabbits along the way, who jump and run and want to not be a part of whatever you have going on. They see you and jump and run, forward in the general direction you are going and you tell them: ""Rabbit, go that way, out of danger if you think I'm danger!""

And the rabbits eventually jump away from you. Into the thickets of the neighbors who would look down on you drinking a beer in the open. A 9% beer, right out in the open. 

So, trying to get the alcoholism just right. And not get fired. Because getting fired means alcoholism won. You have to get alcoholism just right. Wherein, you are just drunk enough to not die but still sober enough to not be fired.

I had a week long vacation. I was supposed to see my parents but, COVID.

Got drunk the entire week.

The day I had to be back at work I was still drunk. No matter how much water I drank.

Side stepping it all the way to work. Get there. Not sure if I should even stay there. At work.

""Zoink, thank God you are here.""

Sigh, look at them, my bosses. 

After a week long bender I realized that I couldn't function without a few drinks before work. Otherwise I would start the withdrawals in the middle of my work day and possibly pass out before the end of the work day.

And that's not cool. Is it?

So, I figured it out. Drink heavily until you pass out after work. Wake up early, seven in the AM, and drink until ten or so and then take a one hour nap. Make breakfast and then drink coffee. All the while make sure that water is involved.

&#x200B;

Then 9 hours of not drinking. Working. Making money.

&#x200B;

""Alright, you guys are fine. Good to see that you've got all your paperwork done....""

&#x200B;

That's when I drone out. When my boss, who is suppose to let us go, just keeps rambling on and on. 

&#x200B;

Because I need it. I need to drink and the pint of 9% ABV is just right there.

&#x200B;

""Hey, Zoinky, Blah, Blah, Blah."" my co-workers say.

&#x200B;

As I'm shoving my shit into my work bag. As I put the all important can of beer into my bag. As I just want to get away.

&#x200B;

""Blah, Blah, Blah!"" they say.

&#x200B;

""Yeah, I'll see you when I see you!"" I say and then run.

&#x200B;

Down the block. Because I want to be a block away before. I don't want anyone to see and potentially report. 

&#x200B;

Then the coughing, then the gagging, and the dry heaving. One block away from work.

Pull out the beer and start doing your alcoholic thing. 

&#x200B;

Rabbits don't run away fast enough for my liking.

&#x200B;

I woke up this morning at 6 am. Drank until 10 am. Fell asleep by 11 am. Woke up with just enough time for either a quick breakfast or a quick shower that would wash all the alcoholism away.

&#x200B;

I elected to eat.

&#x200B;

""Hey, Zoink, let's talk over here."" My boss tells me today.

&#x200B;

Oh, great. This is when I get THE TALK about being drunk at work, I think. I steel myself. 

&#x200B;

""So,"" my boss starts, ""Luke is going for the buyer position and if he gets it then there is a supervisor position open. I think you would be a great fit and I hope you go for it.""

&#x200B;

Right. I'm drunk at work in order to not pass out. And he thinks I should be in charge of things.

&#x200B;

""Yeah, great. Good to know."" I say.

&#x200B;

My boss nods and looks at me. At me, drunk me. I mean not that drunk but I'm drunk enough to get by. He, my boss, looks at me and I can see he actually wants me to say that I would take the position.

&#x200B;

""Okay. Well. Just think about it."" he, my boss, says and then walks away.

&#x200B;

The rest of the night passed just well, I thought. Withdrawals didn't kick in until I left and a block away.

&#x200B;

I choked. And heaved. Found the beer. The 9% beer. Drank. All was good.

&#x200B;

As I walked home along the sidewalks of residential homes everything seemed darker than normal. I realized that it was because people had taken down their Christmas lights. 

&#x200B;

I stumbled upon a break in the sidewalk I usually avoid. I tripped but didn't fall.  Something caught my eye as I righted myself. A rabbit running away from me.

&#x200B;

""Run, rabbit,"" I said, ""run.""",1611201239

So crackheads tried to steal my brother's truck apparently,30,l1pffb,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l1pffb/so_crackheads_tried_to_steal_my_brothers_truck/,14,"Fucking eh, woke up at my brother's place this morning hungover AF, checked my BAC and it was actually zero so I went to take the drive to the liquor store, less than a mile. But on my way to my car I see my brother's truck canopy is completely shattered. The fuck? Went and checked it and found it unlocked(was locked for sure last night) and his ignition system totally fucked, they used a flathead screwdriver to pry open the key system(or w/e it's called), and attempted to turn the ignition with it. Might have worked except that old piece of crap has been parked since like October and the battery was dead flat. Checkmate methhead piece of shit. Left the screwdriver behind which is how I figured out exactly what he did.

At some point he must have shattered out the back window, grabbed a few small tools, almost nothing stolen really. This fuck did well over 1k in damage to get like 40$ of tools. Truck is pretty much a write off.

Brother is understandably pissed but at least it's not his primary vehicle. Called the cops but vehicle break ins are getting so common in this town that the cops wouldn't even come out for it. Bro filed a report online, yeah I'm sure that'll go somewhere lol.

Went and bought a case of beer for my brother and one for me and we're drinking and mourning the death of that old truck. 96 Dodge Dakota sport, so many camping and fishing memories in that old beater. She deserved a better end than to go out at the hands of some junkie. I really need to move out of this town, it's goin to shit.

6 years ago.,34,l1ni5m,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l1ni5m/6_years_ago/,6,"6 years ago I was walking down the middle of a busy street, in the snow, with no street lights. I guess I wasn't trying to kill myself, otherwise I would have gone into one of the lanes, and not the middle.

I was taking a lot of benzos, opiates, alcohol, whatever I could get my hands on. Someone sent me a text saying ""You need help"". She book ended the relationship by saying ""in fact you are far beyond help"". 4 years between those 2 statements. 2 years later, I've proved it wrong. I helped myself. 

I am glad I didn't kill myself, I didn't die. There was more ropey times after that. Jumping train barriers and just my fucking luck there being police on the other side who shouted at me and called me a fucking dickhead. All right I'll just run back the other way.

Back when I was 20, 21, mixing heroin with zopiclone with wine. My mom found me half dead and was crying. Just numerous times I mixed so many downers I should have died. I guess I just wasn't a rock star.

Like many of my rambling posts, I don't know where I'm going with this, only, I'm at an age now I never thought I would make. Most people hate turning 30, get depressed. Fuck naw, when I turn 30, I'm guna celebrate the shit out of it cos this is a time and a point in life that if you asked younger me, they would have laughed at you and said I'd be dead by now.

First in line.,141,l1ag9x,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l1ag9x/first_in_line/,53,"Woke up this morning at 0300. Do that a lot. It's weird how the CA life just completely alters your day/night cycle. Sober, I usually go to bed anywhere from 12 to 3 AM and wake up between 8 and 11. Really used to piss off CA Ex Girlfriend, her circadian rhythms were so hard-wired she woke up at like 5 or 6 every day, without fail. When I'm on a bender I'll pass out at 11 or 4 and wake up wondering what year it is.

2 beers left. Shit. Should have gone to the liquor store last night. I had two shooters saved ""in case of emergency"" and it looks like I'll probably have to use them. So I sip my beers and watch YouTube videos as I eye the clock. I'm resolved to go to the liquor store as soon as they can serve alcohol. I live in one of those states where you can't buy any booze between certain hours, namely 2-6AM here. Never made any sense to me. The only people who are going to be trying to buy alcohol at those hours are either hardcore alcoholics or people coming off third shift. If it's the former you're not exactly going to 'cure' them by not allowing them to drink at certain times; if it's the latter you're just unnecessarily punishing people. Coming from England, with its 24-hour liquor licenses, I'm just fundamentally incapable of accepting these kinds of restrictive laws. Plenty of times I ended nights out clubbing with mates at 3 or 5 AM and we'd stop by the supermarket to get a bottle of booze on the way home. 

I open the front door to go out for a cigarette and the cat darts out onto the porch. Little shitbag. I quickly pick him up and put him back in the house before he can run off into the darkness. We've been playing this game for weeks. I don't like outdoor cats, they're not very good pets. They come home to eat and maybe nap and then they're gone all day, and when they're home they're not very affectionate. Best cat I ever had was one we wouldn't let out until later in his life, and he was very loving. CA Ex Girlfriend and I used to battle over him going out. I'd treat the front door like a door in a spaceship or something; you go in, you go out, you quickly close the door behind you. She'd pause to have a conversation midway between coming in or out and the cat would just run outside as she absentmindedly held the door open. In principle she acquiesced to my feelings on the matter, but before she left she started using my not wanting to let the cat out as metaphor for ""controlling"" her.

I start to cough, I always do when I drink. It's like smoker's cough x10, but usually leads to puking. I bring up an empty beer can in case I spew and try to spit the phlegm through the hole. It ends up hitting the rim of the can and just sits there like this foamy, clingy, mass of congealed cum. I turn the can on its side to see if the phlegm will trickle down into the hole, but it stubbornly remains stuck to the rim. 

I finish my beers quicker than anticipated and have to move on to the shooters. I don't want to just neck them. The risk of simply spewing them back up is very real and I need to make them last. I don't have anything to mix them with. I drank the last of the soda days ago. There's a bottle of offbrand Dr. Pepper on top of the fridge that's been opened and stood there for months. I tentatively open the bottle, and it still has a little hiss. I taste it; stale as fuck. Then I remember I bought a bottle of Gatorade from the liquor store a few days ago, ostensibly to help with detoxing. Yes! I pour both shots into a glass and try to enjoy the mixer as I watch the clock count down. 

We're at the 5:20 mark and I'm looking at the bottom of an empty glass. Too early to walk to the liquor store, but I have nothing else to drink. Then I remember the mass of Nyquil she left behind. Yes, I know you shouldn't drink that shit; yes, I know liver failure blah blah, but I was desperate. 10% alcohol is still alcohol. So I poured out a couple of measures and mixed it in with some Gatorade to sup slowly while I watched more stupid YouTube videos.

The magic hour arrives and I suit up to head to the liquor store. I'm walking with a noticeable limp. My hip has been hurting for months; I put any weight on my left leg and I'm in considerable pain. Maybe I have gout. Doesn't help that I'm wearing shoes one or two sizes too big for me that cut into my ankles when I move my feet. So I hobble my way to the liquor store. The streets are quiet. Street lighting isn't very good; a couple of times I see the silhouettes of people crossing the streets and wonder if they're even real. I'm on auto-pilot and only just realize I've gone a route I only take in the day and try to avoid at night. CA Alley. It's filled with empty shooters and needles in the day, and the odd, crazy, homeless person. Too late to turn back now. I dread being accosted by some hobos or drug dealers but CA Alley is surprisingly clear. 

I don't have a watch or my phone on me so I don't know the time, but I hope it's late enough they unlocked the beer fridge. I wonder who's serving; I imagine it's Tattoo Guy but it turns out to be Mexican Comedian. I think he's a new starter. I don't remember him working there when we first moved in. He's a cheeky chappy; passes himself off as this sarcastic, comedic, guy. He's entertaining, to a degree. He seems a little unsure of himself, maybe on account of how short he is, but I could imagine him being an MTV host or something because he's charismatic. He's having a long conversation in Spanish with the dude in front of me. No idea what they're saying so I look around in boredom. I casually notice there's two other dudes behind me with beer. I suddenly feel better about myself. Like, I'd imagined the usual look of professional indifference or the scorn of ""you're buying alcohol at *this* hour!?"" but other people in the store getting booze too makes me feel better. I know the staff don't question if I'm some third shift guy, I'm in there every day at various times buying booze. They know I'm a CA. 

I walk home through CA Alley and wonder if I should have one of my shots. I usually do, but the last time I did I spewed up, and I've been spewing up a lot. Get home to find the cat on the front porch; he jumped out of the hole in the front window CA Ex Girlfriend smashed. Should probably patch that up already. Pick him up and bring him back in. Safe and sound with beers. Time to drink until I pass the fuck out again.

Surfacing

 

Consciousness happens in snippets.  A few minutes of a movie.  A memory of pictures on the coffee table.  Getting the handle out of the freezer.  Going down the aisle of a grocery store.  Vomiting bile for what felt like an eternity. It’s all jumbled, though.  Time has lost all meaning.  What day is it, anyway?

I come to on the floor of my bedroom.  It’s like floating upwards.  Like surfacing from some foggy dream.  My entire body is shaking, and I’m not wearing a shirt.  It’s a small room and dirty laundry is everywhere.  My eyes are dry, and so is my mouth.  My vision is blurry.  It’s dark.  A smoky smell registers in my brain and grabs my attention.  I get up and stumble to the kitchen. I left the oven on.  There’s a half-eaten pizza next to the sink.  I didn’t light the place on fire.  Not this time, anyways. 

A quick look in the trash bin reveals several empty bottles.  A check of the freezer gives me some relief.  Half a handle sits there, a light frost on the clear glass.  I get a drink of water and check the time.  It’s 2:18 in the morning, but the question of what day it is still nags at me.  Am I supposed to be to work in a few hours?

I pour a shot of rotgut and check my phone.  It’s Monday.  Fuck.  After I knock the booze back, I try to think about where Sunday went.  And Saturday for that matter.  A light sweat glazes my skin as I picture the day ahead.  My back and guts hurt a little. I focus on my lost time, instead. 

I remember the bar.  It’s my usual hangout, and I was there with another degenerate that I consider a friend.  We bought rounds for each other until the evening blurred into a mix of neon lights, sports television, and wood paneling. My friend left.  I went to the store, I think.  Was that Friday?  No. I realize that it was Thursday.  I called in to work on Friday.  Three days gone, just like that. 

There’s something I love about ice cold vodka before dawn.  I take another shot, and I head to the bathroom to assess the damage.  Greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, body odor, and bad skin.  Check, check, check, and check.  I turn on the bath water, unable to remember when the last time I showered was.  I undress and pull the tab.  There’s an unexplained bruise on my left leg, but it’s not too bad. 

Stepping under the warm water is like a breath of life.  I feel it cascading over my face and down my body.  I take a moment to appreciate this small comfort before the anxiety creeps back in.  Should I call in to work again?  I decide against it, because I’ll just keep rolling all day, and I’ll be in the same spot tomorrow.  Besides, I’m running out of paid time off.  And excuses.

A disjointed memory of walking somewhere comes to me suddenly.  I remember the cold air and the gray sidewalk, the dirty, half-melted snow, and the brown lawns of the neighborhood.  It was daytime, but the memory seems a bit blurred.  A bit unsteady.  Was I going to the liquor store?

After drying off, I look at myself in the mirror and wonder how I let it get to this point.  I studiously ignore the little voice in the back of my head telling me that there’s still time to get help.  I look myself in my bloodshot eyes as I turn out the light.  Some vague memory of childhood surfaces just then.  I ignore that too.

I down another shot and head to the bedroom.  I actually make it to the bed this time.  Lying on unwashed shirts and boxers, I check my phone again.  3AM.  I check my messages.  Apparently, I spent quite a bit of time messaging someone from a dating app.  I read the exchange, and I have no recollection of any of it.  I’m checking to see how embarrassing it was, but it seems that I did alright.  I even told her I was headed to bed, instead of my usual passing out in the middle of the conversation.  She’s kind of cute.  I briefly wonder how I’ll mess this up.

I manage to fall back asleep, but it’s fitful.  I hate this time of night.  I can feel the alcohol leaving my body.  I can feel the twitches and shakes, even in my sleep.  I dream a little.  I’m watching myself run, but I’m not sure where I’m going, or what I’m running away from.  Then I jerk awake, sweat sheening across my face and chest.  It’s a little after five now.  I’m desperately tired, but I don’t want to go back to sleep.  Another drunken memory flits into my head before I get out of bed.  I was listening to music at some point.  I was crying.

I’m shaky.  I’m in the weird in-between where I’m not really sober, but I’m definitely not drunk.  I’m hitting zero again and anxiety hits me in waves when I think about how to get through the day.  Another shot settles the nerves as I get dressed in the dark.  Drinking at work is risky business, but I decide to fill a hip flask and stuff it in my coat.  I grab a travel size mouthwash while I’m at it.  I hate myself for making these preparations, but that doesn’t stop me.

I brush my teeth and slather on some deodorant and aftershave, and then I’m off.  I chide myself a bit when I realize that I forgot to lock the front door again.  I walk to the bus stop.  It’s cold and windy, but it feels good and wakes me up a little.  I see the same bus driver day in and day out.  He gives me a nod, which I return.  We’ve never actually talked to each other. 

I take my seat and do my best to zone out for the trip to work.  I stare at my reflection in the glass, and I wonder again how it came to this.  Have I actually come to the surface for real, or if this is just a temporary return to consciousness?  I meekly conclude that it doesn’t matter.  I’m going to find myself in the same situation again, and likely soon.",1611193529

They aren't bad by any means, but there's something really nostalgic about Fellowship, I think I was 8th grade when it came out, I saw it in theaters 3 times, I'd never done that before or since with any movie. A very innocent age, no cell phone, dial up internet, and some semblance of social media was only just beginning to gain momentum. No booze.

Take me back.

My cat is spooning with me and making little cooing pigeon noises, hmphs and little vibratey sighs as he purrs. I call him 'pigeon boy' and scritch his head, he gives me a smug half lidded stare while purring, then buries his head in to my armpit. I call him my little Frodo, he takes an overly dramatic deep breath, puffing him up like a furry ballon, then deflates as he chortles out a sigh and goes quiet, shutting his tired eyes.

I was dared to drink the whole bottle of Appleton rum.

Last Weekend Sent Me Back To A Trip Down Delirium Lane,57,l0ptam,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l0ptam/last_weekend_sent_me_back_to_a_trip_down_delirium/,13,"This  is my first time posting here, but reading some other people's stories  and reading their remarks of it having somewhat of a therapeutic effect,  I'd like to try it for myself. So here goes nothing.

Last  weekend my favourite football team won. That doesn't really sound like a  specific reason to start a binge, because you can drink just as hard  when they lose. But the team I support isn't known for winning, but it  happens a lot lately. Last weekend I drank like six 9,5% craft beers  during the match to keep the nerves down. After the sweet taste of  victory, I decided to add a few more to the tally. I biked home through  the snow, but decided to visit my dad (who is always very negative and  pessimistic about my favourite footballteam's chances of winning) to  taunt him. I did the taunting whilst drinking 2 glasses of double  (triple maybe) Laphroaig whisky (I wasn't too meticulous when pouring  the drinks), and 2 IPA's after that.

Then  it happened. I entered the drunk, subconscious pleasure of being on the  ferriswheel. I didn't take long for me to throw up all around my  parents' living room, inducing my annual sort-of-intervention about my  drinking game. After being called a lowlife drunk and a  good-for-nothing-primate, my mind soon started drifting off to the last  time I can recall emptying my drunk stomach somewhere. It was in South  East Asia, in Bangkok. And after being in bed I started thinking about  how beautiful it was to drink in SEA.

You  see, drinking in SEA is beautiful. I am from a pretty small village  where everyone knows everyone. If I would stumble into a bar at noon or  have a morning whisky at a regional restaurant, everyone would instantly  know about it. But in Asia, you can just drink and no one will bat an  eye. Nobody knows you. And you can get beer every-fucking-where. At  (night)markets, at temples, at nice waterfalls, on the beach, in the  seedier Soi's, in malls, at your hotel. It's magnificent. And there I  was, in my bed, having a hangover and muscle pain from the gagging I did  the night before, thinking back of the beautiful times and the hassles  of drinking in Asia.

The first  time I went to Thailand was with a soon-to-be-ex. We were together for  almost 3 years, but the trip was a sad little last attempt at a futile  resurgance. With some brilliant improvisation, I acted like I had a big  fear of flying, which made sure that I could drink for at least 90% of  the 12 hours flying time on our China Airlines aircraft. After two hours  the only male steward wouldn't pour me drinks anymore, but the ladies  were a lot easier, so I had no lack of alcohol. Landing at Suvarnabhumi,  I instantly walked over to a 7/11, where I bought two big bottles of  Chang, asking the lady at the counter to quickly open them for me before  my ex could intervene.

And there,  in our first minutes on Thai soil, THE fight took place. She called me  an alcoholic that really needed help, who couldn't stop drinking, and  she promised me to break up with me when we got back home. I hadn't ever  backpacked before and thought I could ease in it a bit since there were  two of us, but she angrily stepped into the Skytrain and blazed off.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I think I can safely say that this was the  moment I was truly bit by the travel bug.

I  saw a smoking area outside, stepped out, got hit by the heat, realized I  was still wearing way too hot clothes, and first stumbled to a toilet  to swap those clothes for some flipflops and shorts. Ofcourse, I took  both my bottles of Chang. When I was done changing clothes, I got a  third bottle. I sat outside and instantly got into a conversation with a  man who instantly told me the reason he was in Thailand: Soi Cowboy. I  had never heard of this street, but I made sure I remembered it. In the  meantime my girlfriend kept calling me where I was. I didn't answer. I  had 4 more bottles of Chang with this fat piece of shit outside  Suvarnabhumi airport, called for a cab, payed waaaay to much money to  throw me off at my hotel, walked into the room when my girlfriend was  showering and fell asleep. When I woke up, she told me she was going  home.

Score! I remember feeling  nothing but pleasure when she notified me of her decision, but acted  badly that I wanted her to stay. She could read that I wasn't meaning it  and got back to the airport an hour later. I just had to notify my  family at home sooner than she would. But I had slept and the tipsy  phase worn out a bit, so first I decided to get some more of this  godlike nectar called Beerlao. Tipsy, I called my parents and told them I  was a free man and I would be home in 4 weeks. Then, my adventure  started, and it made me go back to South East Asia for 5 years in a row,  until the genius rona-phase we are in now. Tales of one night stands,  backpacker-relationships, fights, vomit, everlasting friendships, night  in jails and broken bones.

If  anyone is interested in the story, I would be willing to write them down  here. If I am just a blabbering prick who thinks he is waaaay more  entertaining than he really is, tell me and I will stfu.

Maggot ramen and a psychotic break,53,l0giue,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l0giue/maggot_ramen_and_a_psychotic_break/,79,"Title says it all. I've lost my shit. 

Had no choice but to stay with creepy neighbor. He's exploited this for sex. Feels like having sex with my dad. But it was better than being cold and my pets hungry. 

Then I was HUNGRY. Hadnt ate in idk when. Almost weeks. Months maybe, I don't fucking know what I last ate was. Nothing to eat around here. He wont buy food. But my hands are seizing, they won't uncurl. My legs wont work. Shit. I know this. The incessant vomiting and trying to chug water to get the bile out. Now I'm sleeping in the bathroom floor.

Potassium. Hypokalemia. Fuck

I've been to the hospital 4 times in the last month. My liver is almost shot. I just want FOOD. Asked the nurse for some damn chicken broth and got tomato soup. I'm not good at math, but, adding an acid to an acid scoured stomach? They snuck cans in to my bag of nausea meds like I'd eat them. I appreciate their efforts but they still sit there. 

Creepy neighbor wont buy food cause hes a 68 yr old toddler that cant handle ""weird"" food when he doesnt even have to eat it. V8. Spinach. Squash. Ensure. Hot dogs. Mac n cheese. Fucking pedialyte. Pickles. Alfredo?! (Man come on) seafood? Nope, it's just cheeseburgers and pizzas around here. I'm not  kidding. 

I caught creepy neighbor stealing stuff out of my home too. This bitch really thinks I'll be cool, or maybe that he can get away with it. Nope, confronted him and lost my shit. Rage potato. He seemed to smell the storm brewing and magically my stuff returned. Today, I found more of my stuff he had hidden in his drawers. My nintendo switch console, my crochet patterns, and a spare set of MY keys. Nice. Decided to just hook up the switch to the tv with MY hdmi cord he had and own it. Also fun.

I was so hungry I went to my house and salvaged some food. Ramen. Yum I guess. Cup of noodles or whatever. It had a maggot on top, expected. Throw that one away and wait.

I dont wanna remember details but I know I had A LOT of vodka and I was literally starving. Like no joke, need food now hungry. I can feel them crawling up my throat. Threw up multiple times. This was 2 days ago and I still feel it. I had to eat it twice.

Then, a random stranger bought me a dozen subs out of nowhere. Shes also a CA. I've never cried so hard.

My bestie tells me I need to leave this place, get rid of my house and go. My old house is crushing me, and maybe shes right. I need to sell it and get cause this is wearing on me

Snagged some pics from my house today. And watched them all move and talk to me. My mom. I miss you. Dad, I wish I could go back in time and not be such a moody teen. 

Found the big portrait pic of mom and dad the fam made, turns out its moody teen me with my parents, and my family (not parents) cropped me out of. And this is why they can suck a fucking asshole's shit right out of it. 

Thanks. Chairs. I'm mad and stashing my wine from creepy neighbor cause this bitch thinks I magically wont drink if he says no. 

Comment your best hiding places. Mine is the shampoo bottle.

"Got fired again, greaattttt",191,l06gx4,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/l06gx4/got_fired_again_greaattttt/,109,"Whew lads hope all is well. Well just because I'm in desperate need of story time I figured I'd share this with everyone. What was the biggest time you had one event lead to really letting you lose your shit? I just had the oddest spell of events recently and I just got fired about an hour ago during lunch so I'm still trying to piece it all together... \[I mean hey I guess on the bright side its not like I was married at least with kids but Jesus I still have to eat and a disabled mother to provide for.\]

This particular one started fairly innocuous a few months ago, I met and connected with a beautiful girl on a dating app after being out of a long term relationship and we began to see each other. Of course it was during the WORST time to be meeting someone: thanksgiving, Christmas and new years time. Funny part is I'm huge fucking degenerate but also an attorney so I think I managed to slip under her radar as a crazy. She made me feel good, got my confidence up and shit I even stopped drinking during most of December because she doesn't do any drugs or drink so I figured there's no way she's going be able to handle my drunk self. So I started lifting weights again, actually cut my hair for once, became more well groomed, etc. but there was always a crack just ready to shatter in that foundation...

Well this was one of those odd flings because we bought each other presents, use to eat at parks (covid right?) and do cutesy stuff together... We went to Vegas during covid and drive in movie theaters. Then comes Christmas and I find out my family has cancelled their plans \[okay sure sounds good to me, time to get tanked!\] If I'm being honest I was probably heavily depressed with the holidays coming up and literally feeling like nobody gave a shit about me (I mean I was dating but I didn't think she really cared). Well this nice girl who at this point I had been seeing since early November is a nurse by trade and is all about the money so she was working all the major holidays (she made sure I knew lol) so I figured she's not going to see me on Xmas if we didn't see each other on Thanksgiving. Well bad calculation on my part, I start getting all these texts about ""hey babe what are you doing"" blah blah and I'm probably like half a bottle of Jameson in. Even though I was inebriated I knew better than to have her come over because she isn't a drinker or a smoker so I basically blew her off and told her we should just play games (she's a twitch gamer girl).

She agrees to that so we get to our gaming. At this point I'm so fucked up I'm like that kid on the basketball court that is talking shit, thinking he's the shit but bricks almost every shot. She voices her displeasure. At the time maybe I was just too drunk or didn't care but I paid it no mind since hey I'm a drunk sometimes this side comes out. \[Well enter the next day.\]

She's slightly not as receptive to my texts, so shit I figure not a problem maybe she's just busy. I'm usually much more crazy when I'm drunk so I didn't think much. As the day progresses I can start to realize though that she's becoming distant, I start popping the beer because the work day is over and get online to start gaming figuring hey it will be different if we just game and I'm not texting her weird shit. All of a sudden I notice that I can't find her on my friends list.... I start to question, hmmm that's weird maybe I did that when I drunk? 

At this point I've already had a few beers on an empty stomach so I start the text to her pretty calmly asking her if she wanted to play games. She basically just tells me that it isn't going to work out and for me to leave her alone. I gotta give it to her.... She slowplayed me to the T. I refused to take that for an explanation because it just wasn't an explanation at all tbh. I demand she gives me an explanation. She then blocks me on text. I get super pissed and start texting her on google message (I have had experience being blocked and know how to get around it lol) and she finally says she can't see me because ""I'm emotionally unstable."" I don't know what it was but it almost felt like that meme where it says ""and that was the moment that...."" I couldn't handle this, we had a bunch going on and then you just dropped me literally still hot and fresh out of the oven.

I started getting furious, naturally drinking to fuel this unreasonable fire. I start insulting her, saying whatever the fuck I want and none of it is nice. \[Fade to black\] 

At some point I woke up the next day on my floor next to my bed. I'm kind of doing one those ""'doh not again moments!"" when I realize its actually 1pm on a Monday morning. O SHIT I HAVE WORK. But the aftermath of my drinking is already apparent, I'm shitting blood, dry heaving and with crazy head pains, \[like can't do anything type of shit.\] I furiously try to find some more booze to take the edge off and sign into work, shit storm of emails. \[Short backstory but I had a no call no show back in December so I think it was already a bit dicey.\] They are just not happy. I have all these emails putting me on blast and like I said I'm an attorney so its a stressful job but ultimately I do have responsibilities. 

Well that 1pm booze I was hitting must have been kicking in different or something because once I saw all those emails I just basically said ""you know what? fuck all this. I'm going back to booze and then sleep bc I frankly don't give a damn."" Then I get a weird text from a cousin who has now informed me that my grandma has been dead for over a month (covid) but they are doing the funeral tomorrow. Well RIP grandma but you were always kind of a piece of shit to me and wrote my immediate family out of your will so NAH but hey why not drink more because she's dead and that's affecting you! The bender ensues.

Honestly guys I know we joke about it but when was the last legitimate time you had a long bender? I'm talking like you are drinking from sun up to sun down shit. Well this developed into that. I'm now drinking a 750 ml bottle and at least 4 heavy beers every day and also still haven't reported to work. Anxiety is going up the roof but I finally managed to send a drunken email on Tuesday about not being able to show up till Monday due a family passing. The drinking continues to rock star levels, party of one.

Six days pass, its finally Monday again \[today\]. That time warp shit is real. I look around my room - it smells like shit (literally because of my nasty beer sweating ass), there were 9 jameson bottles around my room all tapped and various amounts of micro brewery beer (the 8%+ stuff). Literally looking like some hoarders/intervention shit. I casually clock back into work then I get the sweet sweet email from HR: ""Hello please give this person a call to discuss a few things about last week."" I give them the Disney version and just reference the email I had sent reflecting my grandma's passing. The lady says she needs to discuss this with her manager and hangs up. Hmm I lament, that was really not the answer I was looking for (although I should expect considering I left the job for a week). My boss insists I continue to work until I hear from HR so I do.

More stressful times? Well might as well drink as I'm drafting this motion! All of a sudden I get a phone call again from someone I don't know. They informed me that they had a few other people on the call my managing attorney being one of them. They let me know that being tardy like that is unacceptable and blah blah and then let me know I am being let go. I give them the corporate speech of being appreciative, thank you for your patience, etc. Dead silence on the phone: ""So do you have anything else to say?"" I'm like no then they just straight up hang up on me. Pretty razzle dazzle day, going to get a few beers in me and assess this tomorrow. Chairs.",1611040623
Pint of puke.,98,kzzgm9,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kzzgm9/pint_of_puke/,65,"I'm sitting here looking at a pint glass of my own puke, on the desk next to my laptop. After every few beers or so I'd feel my mouth start to pool with saliva and then my guts would suddenly heave. I knew I wouldn't be able to make it to the bathroom so I just reached for an empty glass I'd used to drink a mixer and spew in it. As is the way it's never just one; you think you're fine and then there's this sudden urge to clear your throat, so you cough and your guts just seize again. So I gradually filled up this pint glass of puke over the last few days. I should toss it out. It looks gross; like warm beer with a foamy head, flecked with red bits of what I assume are my digestive system. It's giving off a distinct aroma of apple flavored vodka. I thought I'd down a shooter to hurry up the incoming pass out, but I ended up just puking it right back up. I could smell and taste the apple as it came out.

I did a thing yesterday. I was feeling depressed and drunk as fuck so got on a bus to visit someone. A few years ago I cooked for, and eventually ran, a homeless veterans camp that I lived at. We had a resident there who self-identified by the name of ""Cornfed"" (something to do with his home state being renowned for growing corn or something). The guy sounded like a real-life Boomhauer from *King of The Hill*; constant, incomprehensible, rambling with a Southern drawl. You could never ask him a simple question and expect to get a straight answer. Maybe, I guess, because he thought it was funny to fuck with people so. You could ask him ""hey, what day is it?"" and he'd still be babbling random nonsense 30 minutes later. I never knew what the fuck he was saying, so there was a lot of smiling and nodding on my part. Dude liked to eat, and he *loved* my cooking; I'd always see him wolf down whatever I'd served and rejoin the line for seconds. He was a real gentle giant; 6'3 or so, built like a linebacker, I never heard him raise his voice in anger to anyone. Carried with him everywhere a little chihuahua that he doted on. 

Dude liked to drink too. I bought his loyalty one time, literally, when I offered to walk to the liquor store for him when he wanted a drink. He complained he didn't know where the closest liquor store was and would never be able to walk there in time. I like to walk, and at the time I was sober, so I didn't mind walking to the liquor store on behalf of our CA residents (of which we had a few). I told him where the nearest liquor store was and when he complained it was too far away for him to walk to before it closed, I offered to go there for him. I remember he wanted me to get him a pint of peppermint schnapps and he eyed me somewhat dismissively as he put the cash in my hand. I didn't begrudge him his caution, when you're homeless entrusting your money to other homeless people is extremely risky; 9 times out of 10 they'll just take your money and run, spend it on booze, or drugs, or cigarettes. We had so many residents who disappeared after someone gave them with as little as $10. I made it to the liquor store and back in record time, I even had a receipt and his change. His face *lit up* when I came back. ""Thank you!"" he kept repeating ""thank you! You're a good man!"" So he shotgunned his schnapps and drunkenly wandered around the camp for a while before passing out. 

After that his demeanor and attitude towards me seemed to change. He became very jovial and protective over me. I was serving soup for our residents one time and someone cut the line. I asked the person to please take their place in the line and wait to be served, but he insisted I serve him now. Cornfed got right in his face, towering over this guy and shouting ""you need to respect this man! He cooks for us and y'all wouldn't eat for shit if he didn't!"" Cornfed eventually got into housing, which was ostensibly what our camp was there for. Homeless veterans get free housing, and the process of getting off the streets and into housing is ridiculously fast for them compared to Section 8. I'm talking days or weeks vs. the months or years normies have to wait. No one was especially sad to see him go, he had few friends there on account of his rambling and no one understanding what the hell he was saying. I shook his hand and bade him good luck as he packed up his things and made ready to leave, I don't think he even registered I was there as he continued to prattle on about everything and nothing.


Fast forward to the tail end of last year and as CA Ex Girlfriend and I were going home on the bus I espied a man flying a sign on a street corner across from a liquor store. ""Homeless vet, please help"" it read. He had the right frame, height, and even his little chihuahua with him. I told CA Ex Girlfriend about him and lamented we didn't get off the bus to give him some change. I decided to go out yesterday and find him to give him some beer money. 

He was there on his usual corner, flying his sign, dog underarm like the last few times I'd seen him. Any doubts I had that it might have been someone other than him disappeared as I came closer. ""How's it going?"" I asked as I approached ""pretty good, buddy. Spare some change for a homeless veteran?"" I asked him if he didn't recognize me. He scrutinized me in silence as I practically heard him think *who is this guy?* I took off my mask and sunglasses and smiled and I saw the flash of recognition in his eyes. ""It's you! Cook guy! Man you made some good shit!"" he laughed. I explained to him that I'd seen him flying his sign on that corner a few times and specifically came out to visit him. I asked him why he was out on the streets again when the last time I saw him he'd just gone into housing. ""Government bullshit"" was the most I could get out of him. I told him I had some spare change for him and fished out my wallet. I thought I had a couple of bucks or a fiver but I only had a single $20 bill. *Fuck it*, I thought, *he probably needs it more than me*. His face lit up like it was Christmas. ""Are you sure? Oh man, thank you brother!"" he beamed.

He told me to wait where I was while he went into the liquor store, chihuahua propped underarm. He came out with a large brown paper bag with some kind of bottle in it and asked me if I wanted to hang out with him and have a drink. ""Sure"", I told him, ""why not?"" We found a quiet little side street to sit in before he pulled out his prize: a large bottle of bottom-shelf vodka. I noticed his hands shaking as he swigged a couple of large draughts. He burped and it smelt like what I imagine jet fuel does before he offered me the bottle. I had a couple of swigs but declined anymore. I was already wasted and still had to get home; I didn't want to pass out in an alley from too much vodka. Besides, it was his and that's what I'd come there for. 

We talked for a while. I told him about some of the people we lived with at the homeless veterans camp who'd died since we last saw each other. He didn't seem to remember any of them. I tried to get him to open up more about why he was on the streets again but he only made vague allusions to ""people don't like it if you act a certain way"" or ""politicians don't like it if you think this way"" and just rambled on incoherently. I guessed the fact he was swigging from a bottle of vodka in an alley in broad daylight had something to do with it, but I dropped the line of questioning. It became small talk, which I've never been good at, so I shakily stood up, dusted off, and bid him adieu with his bottle of vodka. ""Hey, thanks for coming"", he said, with what seemed to be a sincere smile. 

I don't know why I did that. I mean, *I do*: I was drunk, but I don't know what possessed me to go out and give the last of my cash to a homeless CA who I knew would just drink it away. Maybe it's because I've been a homeless CA too - and could be again - and know what it's like. Maybe it was my determination to prove to myself I'm not a bad person, like CA Ex Girlfriend maintains I am.

Speaking of her, she came back into the picture, like some of you predicted. I was taking a shit, drinking a beer, and browsing Reddit when I saw an incoming call from a local number. It was a Saturday but I figured, *hey, it could be a job*. I pinched off the last of my CA ass piss, cleared my throat and in my best professional voice answered the call. ""Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?"" It sounded like CA Ex Girlfriend. It...it couldn't be. It was definitely a local number calling, I pulled the phone away from my face to double check. ""Who is this?"" I cautiously asked, ""who do you think? It's [CA Ex Girlfriend]"" my blood ran cold. ""Why are you calling from an Arizona number? I thought you were in New York?"" ""I came back to the state, I'm in the hospital right now"" she says, matter-of-factly. I ask her what she wants and she says she ordered some ID to come to my address. ""Why didn't you get it in New York? I thought your life was so perfect there with Rapey Ex"", ""I'm...not sure that's where I wanted to be."" I hear hesitancy, perhaps a note of regret in her voice. I ask her where she's going after the hospital, cutting off the idea of her coming back here. ""Somewhere safe"" she sniffs. I roll my eyes, she's carrying on the battered housewife narrative and her Internet boyfriends have enabled the delusion. ""Sure, whatever"" I say, ""if and when your ID comes I'll text you and you can get it from the mailbox. I don't want you coming back here."" ""I wouldn't want to anyway!"" she bites back. Gimme a break.

She gets out of the hospital and apparently rents a room from someone. She continues to message me, at least once a day, and I just ignore them. No more phone calls and rambling voicemails like she used to. Not a single peep about the shit that went down over Christmas and it starts to make me angry. She sends me a message about begging me for something, or to be a certain way over Christmas and I just lose it. I tell her all this went down because she started drinking again, and instead of sobering up and trying to make things right she flew across the country to fuck an ex boyfriend who she claimed raped her. I tell her I don't want to deal with her until she's sober and ready to apologize for being a drunk mess. She blocks me on Facebook.

She messages me one night and says she's moving to San Diego and that's my last chance to see her. Fucking San Diego. She's obsessed with the place. Last year she wanted us to move there and even told me ""I'm moving there with or without you."" She hates Tucson, never misses an opportunity to shit on the place; ""I have never seen worse drivers in the country than in Tucson!"", ""I have never met more racist people in the country than in Tucson!"", ""I have never been somewhere with worse water quality than in Tucson!"" I gently try to redirect her ""babe, do you think it's *really* that bad, or you just hate the place and you're making up excuses to confirm that?"" So she had her heart set on moving to San Diego, like it was a fantasy land. ""People there are more open-minded"" she'd squawk, ""the only veterans I meet here are scummy addicts!"" I try to point out that might have something to do with the fact that she's been a homeless alcoholic for the last few years. But again, she won't have it. I don't think this place is necessarily *great*, but there's saints and sinners everywhere you go, and the fact that she's *only* been associating with homeless addicts for the last few years doesn't mean everyone here is irredeemably evil, like she thinks. 

She ends up calling, and I expect her to say she's outside the door or something. She says she just wants to talk and she thought we could still be friends. The rage and sorrow well up in me. I tell her I thought we could work things out and that she was calling to apologize, that I'm not friends with exes, because how could you be ""friends"" with someone you hurt or who hurt you? She hangs up and doesn't respond to any of the texts I send her, telling her she needs to quit the victim bullshit. I shotgun a few more beers to just pass out already and fill the pint of puke more.

She texts me today about how wonderful her place in San Diego is and how I need to rethink how I don't treat people with respect. I tell her treating people with respect doesn't involve flying across the country to fuck an ex boyfriend who allegedly raped you. No response. I think she periodically just unblocks me to send me these pithy messages before blocking me again so she doesn't have to hear any criticism. 

I need to call about a job later. It's a good one, back office in a bank. Did that stuff for years in England. I hope I get it. But that's for later. I've had one too many shooters now and it's either filling up the pint of puke or nap time.

I Can Be Broken Too,121,kzq675,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kzq675/i_can_be_broken_too/,41,"There’s something about nights like tonight where I’ve been drinking too much where I feel obligated to open up and spill my heart out to other degenerates. Maybe I don’t belong here, maybe I do. I don’t care. I’m on the wrong side of a case of beer by any normal metric. All I know is I’m able to acknowledge how fucked up I feel. I know that when the morning comes I’m going to feel embarrassed that I let my guard down and I spilled the beans in a public forum and I’ll be scared to see what the response is. Right now though, I don’t care. I need to put feelings into words where it’s still fairly anonymous

Around this time of year, a few years ago, I met one of my best friends. She’s somebody who will always be special to me. I met her at my shitty fucking fast food job when I came begging for my job back and she was applying at the same time. I still remember her sitting in the manager’s office while I walked sheepishly in looking for a place to work while I was off school. We became fast friends there. I looked forward to every shift we worked together even when she fucking pissed me off. 

She moved on though, as did I. I went back to school, she worked elsewhere. We always linked up when I came back and kept hanging out. When I went back to the old job she would always show up at the best possible time to hang out and smoke weed and talk shit to her old managers like a boss. When I went through a bad breakup she was always there to take a drive with me and talk about shit and help me through shit. I wish I had been that good of a friend to her. 

About a year after all that she started seeing a bad dude. She started getting beat on. She showed up to our old job one day with two black eyes and bruises around her throat. Everybody was ready to hunt down the guy who did it to her and fuck him up. She didn’t want that to happen. We ended up all getting drunk together and giving her a safe space to be. I wish we would’ve did the former, but it wasn’t in the cards. It still hurts after all these years because I can still see her in my minds eye with all those bruises. She was one of the strongest people I ever knew but she looked so timid and hurt it broke my heart. 

More time passed, more things changed. She got back together with a guy she had dated in the past that she had always had feelings for. We drifted further apart since we were going different places. One of the very last times we chilled together she broke out a bunch of coke. I knew she had been to rehab for it before and I didn’t touch it but I didn’t judge her for it. She kept apologizing for doing it, but I didn’t really care. I wasn’t happy she was doing it, but at least she wasn’t getting hit anymore. I didn’t think anymore of it. In retrospect, that was probably a bad move

A few months after that, I took a vacation to New Orleans. I had grown up around the area, and when we first met she told me she had been there too. We had always talked about taking a trip down there together but we never did. I didn’t tell her I was going down there for whatever reason. That will always haunt me. Maybe if I had, she would still be alive. 

The day after I got back, I went back to work. An hour and a half into my shift I got word she was dead. At some point during my trip she had gone through a breakup with the boyfriend and she hanged herself. Her family found her and cut her down but it was too late and she had been without oxygen for too long. The day I came back they had decided to pull the plug. I don’t know how I managed to make it through the rest of my shift, but as soon as I was done I got a handle of whiskey and completely broke down sobbing and screaming and drinking the entire night until the next day

The next few weeks were honestly a blur. This happened immediately before Christmas so I didn’t do shit for my family for the holiday. It was just numbness and forced smiles. “Your present’s in the mail”. Not “I don’t have the emotional energy to feel anything or think about making you feel good. I want to die”. 

Her funeral was a few weeks later. I didn’t go. I got insanely shitfaced the night before and used the resulting hangover as a sick note, but it was just an excuse. I couldn’t face that she was gone, and it’s still hard to all these years later. I don’t know why I’m typing all this out except as some kind of anonymous cathartic release. God knows I would never get this real with anybody I know personally. 

If you’ve read this far, moral of the story is there is no moral of the story. I’m not writing this to make a point, or for any reason other than to ease the burden a little bit and get this confession out there. I hate myself for a lot of reasons, but a big one now is I never took her with me on that trip. Maybe she’d still be alive if I had, maybe not. I’ll never know now though. 

Once again if you’ve read this far, or hell, even just skipped to the bottom, suicide sucks ass. I don’t care who you are as a person or how low you are, someone is gonna get hurt, and if you even care about them, you would never wish this on them. 

I guess if there’s any takeaways from this, it’s that if anyone out there is thinking about killing themselves, it’s not hopeless. It’s not pointless. There are people out there who will be hurt by what you do. You have touched so many lives that you probably aren’t even aware of that are thankful you’re alive. For my part, I’m happy you’re alive and I will always be there for you. 

I love you",1610985124

The Urge,31,kzpw97,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kzpw97/the_urge/,3," The sound of my toaster ejecting two slices of burnt toast, took me back to reality. For a brief moment, my mind was empty, no thoughts, no fear, no joy, nothing. I ceased to exist, it was nice while it lasted. Waking up and still beeing pretty drunk is a state of mind that I have always enjoyed.

I choose to ignore the pain that the heat from the toast is transmiting into my fingers and take a bite. My day has just started, yet im already struggling. With eating toast. Its too dry, maybe some jelly will do the Trick.

I open the fridge and check my supplies, my eyes wander from one item to another. Like a car thats about to run over a deer, my eyes have come to a fullstop, I discovered the vodka. I knew I had some left but actually seeing it, makes the temptacion near impossible to withstand. I want to drink it but at the same time I dont. I reach for it and retract my hand immediately. It feels like my body is moving on its own and I barely have time to stop myself.

The bottle is watching me as a spectator while I fight with myself. This fucker surely placed a bet on me, hoping I will go down in the third round.

Im not going down. I grab the jelly and close the fridge.

The toast is now cold, this makes me wonder how long I stood in front of the fridge. I smear some strawberry jelly onto the slice and take another bite, way better.

After eating up the two slices, which by now have become about the only thing I am going to eat for a day, I stand up and go to the fridge to put the jelly back. The urge is even stronger this time. An outsider would look at me and just see a person standing in front of a fridge but there is so much more going on. I want to move away from the fridge, but I cant. It feels like my addiction is holding me in place and I cannot move. All I do is to stare at the wodka and yet my mind is racing. I think of excuses that would justify the drinking, only to supress them in the same second.

This goes on for a while, then I close the fridge.

The smell of cold smoke mixed with old booze forcefully penetrates my nostrils as I enter the living room. I open every window and look at the big pile of empty beercans and vodka bottles. I feel shame and anger towards myself. That is a sight, that I cannot withstand. Thats why my decision to hide it in empty drawers and cabinets seemed like the best solution for now.

As the warm blanket of yesterdays inebriation is slowly beeing pulled away from me, it gets immediately replaced with anxiety. This feeling of demons crawling up on me, setting fire to everything that is positive. Anything that could be considered good or nice just got cancelled out of my vocabulary. I cannot escape this feeling without sacrifice.

So here I am standing infront of the fridge again. All it takes are a couple of big sips to be normal again. This time I dont repress the thoughts that enable my drinking. I dont want to.

Round three Knock out.

POOP POST ALERT! I'm having a bit of fun turning FIGHT CLUB into FART CLUB,7,kzr2u2,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kzr2u2/poop_post_alert_im_having_a_bit_of_fun_turning/,7,"Colin gets me a job as a janitor. Shortly after that, he's shoving a suppository up my rear-end and saying that the first step towards ripping an everlasting fart is to completely cleanse one's colon. For a long time, Colin Prolaps was my best friend. People never asked, and I assume that they didn't want to know, but Colin was always egging me on to push just a little bit harder when farting even though indulging his wishes usually ended up ruining a pair of drawers. This was quickly shaping up to be one of those times.

A turtle head began pressing upon my clean, white undies- my LAST pair of clean, white undies. ""You really won't shit yourself."" Colin insisted. 

I could feel the castor oil begin to squish out from between my buttcheeks. If you want to truly fart hard without crapping your pants, you have to administer castor oil to both ends for at least 24 hours prior to letting it truly rip. Try to fart any sooner than that, and you're guaranteed to launch a big shiny turd like a high-explosive howitzer shell straight through your drawers and down your pant leg. 

""You're thinking of ghost turds. This isn't a ghost turd, Colin.""

The mattress we're lying on won't be salvageable in a few minutes. You take 98% pure castor oil and add three-times the amount of re-fried beans by volume, then wash it all down with a case of PBR and you've got gas that'll melt lacquer from half a mile away.

I know this because Colin knows this. 

Add a pot of strong coffee and you've got a nice clip of wet ones that'll choke a pig, but will melt holes in even the thickest pair of drawers. Some folks swear that loading-up on Metamucil keeps the farts cleaner for longer, but that's never worked for me or Colin. 

So Colin and I are spooning atop a brand-new luxury mattress as the unspeakable contents of my bowels go from asking permission to insisting upon joining the party. Even on a bed this comfy, the sense of what is to come makes it almost impossible to relax. I use the term 'almost' because the one part of my body that IS willing to relax is the one heroically keeping a Pandora's box of the unspeakable at bay. I feel like I have to fart. A little voice inside of me- or is it just Colin whispering to me? I can't tell the difference anymore. The voice is telling me that it's just a fart- that I can let just a little bit out. 

I begin to relax.

It feels dry.

Push a little bit.

The feeling of relief gives way to one of wet, warm filth. The fleeting warmth and feelings of relief give way to shame and panic as the expensive sheets are surely about to be ruined. The half-dissolved suppository seems to slip out, causing a discomforting sensation like you just tried to stick a chicken wing slathered in hot sauce and blue cheese up your ass, but the dressing does nothing to ease the burn, instead helping the hot sauce get into places you didn't even know existed. 

Somewhere in the building, the self-proclaimed Toilet Bowel Cleaners, aka members of Project Plunger, are helping themselves to each and every roll of TP. 

There's an old saying, ""never trust a fart."" Well, maybe this fart shouldn't have trusted ME. 

With all sorts of things having been shoved up your ass, you can only guess at what's going on back there. Even the world's toughest bouncer can only do so much when asked to single-handedly keep a world of literal shit at bay.

Ask me how to make stink bombs from garlic and vinegar. These are the things you won't find online or in cookbooks. You can really ruin someone's day by adding a bit of honey to the mix to make it smell rather pleasant until the concoction gets a minute or two of air-time. Add salt and yeast to a batch in a sealed container and you've got a slow fuse that'll eventually blow when least expected. 

Fake turds? I'll show you how to make ones that look AND smell like the real thing. 

These drawers won't hold up much longer.

Sure, it'll take a while for the devil's hot cocoa to soak through to the mattress, but there's no stopping it. I wonder if my pants are still salvageable. 

In just a few minutes, this toxic sludge will begin to soak into my jeans, then the sheets, the comforter, the mattress cover, then finally, the memory foam.

Colin snuggles closer to me and I feel a warm wetness squish against my butt cheeks. Just a few moments outside of the colon manages to let the mess drop just slightly below body temperature. The uncanny valley that exists between body temp and warm pool water sends chills down my spine. I thought of her- I thought of Anita. 

Anita Whypmoore and Colin Prolaps seemed to be pulling me in two different directions- jockeying for my attention ever since this all began. Either one on their own is about as big a pain in the ass as I could have ever imagined. Dealing with both of them simultaneously is, well, a problem that I haven't the luxury of fixing at my own leisure.

Having Anita Whypmoore AND this Colin Prolaps in my life at the same time was a problem that had been coming to a head for weeks, but hindsight is about as useful as looking at your own asshole in the mirror. Yes, it's a mess back there, but what exactly do you propose to do about it? Sometimes it's best to leave that mystery unsolved- that's why I prefer black or brown drawers, and why Colin only ever wears white ones. Anita preferred red panties, but she had her own issues.

There's no turning back now. This mattress will be ruined in no time. Why oh why didn't I got for the brown set of sheets? Why didn't I opt for the protective cover? Why did I always let Colin call the shots?

I let go of my bowels as Colin squeezes me even tighter. Colin always told me to let it out even if it would surely ruin my pants. Well, Colin, here's to both of our pants being ruined.


Crapter 2

Hugh Jass' buttcrack peeked out from above the waistband of his off-white drawers. I can only assume that those drawers were originally bright white, but Hugh was the sort of guy to run things into the ground. The small patch of hair atop Hugh's crack reminded me of Wilson from Home Improvement. The more you got to see the very top of what was likely a big, fat, hairy ass, the more you wanted to yank down his pants to have a proper look at it. 

""Could you hand me that drain snake? There's something gnarly down here.""

I broke eye-contact with Hugh's coin-slot and rifled through the tool bag for the snake. Random metal washers at the bottom of the bag jingled around like loose change and i was once again fantasizing about dropping a shiny new quarter down the crack of Hugh's ass to see if a stale gumball or cheap keychain would roll out his pant leg. 

""Quit staring at my ass, Seymour."" 

Hugh had taken to calling me Seymour. Seymour Butts was my given moniker since no one really needed or wanted to know my government name. I was a plumber's apprentice who spent most of the workday staring at my mentor's ass. If I simply logged enough hours at the precipice of the human grand canyon, I was told I'd make journeyman some day. 

I still miss Hugh and his ass. I still can't watch re-runs of Home Improvement without crying like a bitch. Speaking of bitch-crying, that's how I met Anita.

Hugh and i worked for a plumbing company that was contracted to work at this haughty-taughty country club where old fucks paid way too much money to walk around naked in the locker rooms, fart in the saunas, and hang out with other old fucks who hated their spouses. 

Hugh was once a private contractor- his own boss. When printed ads and phonebook listings gave way to online directories, scathing tales of his butt crack and beer breath put him at the bottom of the list when searching for plumbers. 

Too many Yelp reviews, and you have to work under someone else's company. 

It's easy to think of yourself as a piece of shit when you spend your days fixing toilets for people who are just as likely to poop in the shower and use their feet to push it down the drain.  

Hugh looks after me because he thinks that my buttcrack and beer breath derailed me from loftier goals, too. 

Around us in the ladies' locker room one day, we were about to extract the treasure of the Sierra Madrid from one of the shower drains. Most women yelled at us for doing this sort of work during daylight hours, insisting that their rapidly thinning hair and copious amounts of shit tickets wait until after hours to completely clog the drains and toilets. 

The sound of flip-flops echoed through the locker room, terminating at the bathroom stalls. Sounds of straining and grunting were followed by what can only be described as explosive diarrhea. The click of a Bic lighter soon followed as the smells of Virginia Slims and liquid death hit my nose at the exact moment that the sounds of contented relief echoed throughout the tile-clad facility. 

""You guys are gonna need more TP!"" she announced.

Neither the sound of the toilet flushing nor that of running water from the sink were heard. Instead, the sounds of zippers being pulled and a heap of clothing hitting the tile floor preceded what was soon to become the all-too-familiar sound of flip-flops on tile. 

Anita casually strode past Hugh and I in full birthday attire to the shower stall adjacent to the one in which we were working. Hugh whistled audibly and Anita flicked her half-spent cigarette in his direction. By some miracle, the still smoldering butt ricocheted off the wall and landed directly in the crack of Hugh's exposed ass. 

Many things changed for me in that moment. For one, Hugh walked off the job making me the de-facto lead plumber on site. Second, I knew true love for perhaps the first time in many, many years. As a mass of hair and turds emerged from the drain that I was working on, Anita let out a grunt and a wet fart. As she stomped the bits of doodoo down the drain and began to lather up be biggest bush I'd ever seen, it occurred to me that she just might be the reason why the shower drains were always getting clogged.",1610989456

She has no limit on what she will talk to me about, and she expects the same from me. It's gotten to the point that I can predict the structure of every conversation we have--a long period of her problems and weird stories, followed by ""When are you going to have a child? Why won't you call your brother?"" followed by gossip about the whole family. These are very long conversations, to say the least.


I decided to attempt to set some boundaries for my mental health. I told her that there were certain things she shouldn't share with me, and that I would let her know if/when I was considering having a child, and that my brother knows how to reach me if he wants to. She took it well-- ""Zaps, I'm sorry I've made you uncomfortable. I will do better.""

I mean, I believed she took it well, because I forgot that I'm a naïve dumbass who always trusts and believes people when I should know better. 


When I was a kid, my biggest fear was that I didn't belong with my family. Part of it was my appearance (I'm like three shades paler than even my white dad was), and part of it was that I just didn't fit in. I asked my mom many, many times if I was adopted. It didn't help that my dad would occasionally 'joke' that I might not be his kid. I also asked my mom about that, and she insisted there was no way that was possible. When I was 16, I finally said, ""Let's just go do a damn DNA test then."" From there on out, we were golden, and I let all my identity bullshit more or less go.


So mom calls today. ""Zaps, there's one thing that's been weighing on me."" She proceeds to tell me that she was sleeping with someone else about a month before she found out she was pregnant, but ""don't worry"" because she's sure that I ""am (my dad's) daughter.""


I immediately hung up. I sent her one last message-- ""As far as I'm concerned, you're as dead as Dad is"" and blocked her number. 

At least she was courteous enough to do this shit on a weekend. I'm a few in now, and I think I'll be able to manage not to do anything too destructive. I'm sure there's plenty of fallout to come, but tonight I am getting absolutely smashed in *peace*.

Anyway, I made up some bullshit to my boss, got a dr note saying everything is peachy, and went on as normal. 

Then it happened again last night, only with no neck brace. It was much more clear cut what failed. Massive dehydration, next to no electrolytes, why the fuck won't i eat? Everyone in the ER probably knew just by looking at me. I've only passed out twice, both at the job im still somewhat knew at. Fuck me walking. 

Anyway, there was this nurse that seemed super concerned. More in just a ""drinking is bad you're killing yourself"" kinda way. I wish i could talk to her more for support, but that would get her fired. Also she dropped a nondenominational church on me and i hate those more than all other churches. Oh well. 

Anyway, i brought my boss a note from the doc saying i could go back to work in a week. His words were ""I'm not firing you, but we have to wait for the owner to OK you to come back at all since this happened at work twice in one month."" And i have to wait till Monday since the owner wants to drink beer and watch football all weekend.

Here we go again,266,ky6jsm,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ky6jsm/here_we_go_again/,47,"Hello my fellow hopeless drunks, dying fools, and hapless disasters,

About two and half years ago on September 7th, 2018, I came-to from a two week black-out, naked with porn playing on my TV. I was living in a studio apartment with a communal bathroom shared by everyone on the floor. All around the twin bed was a sea of empty handles of Ron Diaz rum and two liter bottles of Pepsi. I had no idea two weeks had gone by, so I started my search for ""spiders"" (what I call the last little bit in the bottom of an empty bottle). I was not shaking yet but I knew they were coming. I was able to gather a shot or two into one of the empties, sat down with my prize, and opened my phone. I had started my second semester of college on the 22nd of August and decided to celebrate that achievement by ""having a few"". That was the last thing I remember. This hit me like a ton of bricks; I had done it again. 

I was a about a month behind in rent and my funds were all but gone. I knew I'd be homeless again soon and the thought of being homeless for another South Dakota winter... well I was going to hang it up if I had to do that again. So, that night (after getting well) I went online and applied for a sober house. My last drunk was on the night of September 9th, 2018. I moved in that sober house on the 10th, became the house manager on Halloween of that year, I got a job at a local siding company and became a site supervisor (with a Ford F350 with the company's logo stamped all over it, company credit card and all), and after I moved out of the sober house in November 2019, was asked me to join the board of directors for the sober house. This was a major accomplishment for me. I had been to prison twice, I've been to 4 outpatient and 6 inpatient treatments, in and out of AA since 2003. I've been a meth addicted prostitute, a homeless beggar, I traveled the country with the rainbow hippies for more than a year, moved to L.A. for about two years (let me tell you, for a mid-western guy like me with barely a preschooler's worth of drug knowledge, LA was a college education). I am the definition of a low-bottom drunk. So, when I was asked to help run a sober house... well, I got what I wanted: an amazing ego boost. Solomon said, ""all is vanity"". And he was right. During this time I became heavily involved with AA. I have a sponsor, and currently I have four sponsees. All to satisfy ego.

Today, January 15th 2021, I made a decision to drink again. The White Claw craze happened after I sobered up the last time, so I had to try on of those (verdict: eh). I am a White Claw and three gin and tonics in at the moment. I feel... so much better (super guilty though). All the tension I've been carrying around for the last two years... that tightness in the chest, is melting away. 

I'm completely socially inept. My whole life I've felt as though I don't belong on this planet. I've never ""fit-in"" anywhere. When I drink, I don't feel like I belong, it's more that I feel like I can tolerate this. When I was 18, I met an older man who would give me oxy 80's if I fucked him. So, I did. He also showed me how to inject them. I'm mostly straight, so after a half dozen times of doing this, I just couldn't anymore. However, later in my life, I remembered that I could get stuff for sexual acts with bigger or uglier guys. And I did. After awhile it didn't matter, so I started to hook-up with guys when I was drunk, just for the attention. I hate this part of me. A therapist I once had told me that ""I reliving my childhood sexual trauma"". My only hope is that I do not do that tonight.

I am a long time lurker and first time poster here. I just wanted to scream into the void. If you've made it this far thanks. I'm lost with three guys looking up to me to show them how to stay sober. Fuck me.

It is crazy finding a subreddit of people to relate to on such a fucked up level. I’m only 21, but knew I was an alcoholic in junior year of high school. All of my immediate family were horrible alcoholics. We grew up impoverished, in homeless shelters and hotels, because my mom could never put down the drink. 

Long story but all those years of suffering led me to work in the medical field. I made the stupid decision last July to fly across the country alone to work on the frontlines in a COVID unit at a nursing home. I pushed myself so hard in the name of the “greater good”, helped so many people, but I was killing myself. 16 hour overnight shifts everyday, full of shit, piss, blood, and screaming. 

In school, they stressed the importance of healthy coping mechanisms in this field. I didn’t listen. I would come home at 7am and pummel myself with vodka. 

It wasn’t *that* bad until I started seeing too much death. Deaths that could have been prevented. I realized I was expendable. The mismanagement, underfunding, and general carelessness for people’s lives. I thought getting into this field was a noble thing, as selfish as that sounds, but I soon realized how fucked everything is. I started having nightmares about the job and downing a handle a day. 

We let someone die, and when I voiced my concern about how we badly we failed, I got a raise. Then they paid for my tuition. Just keep working, they said - you’re a valuable member of the team. 

And I know I was. I loved my patients and I cared so deeply for them. I busted my ass so hard at that facility. But the drinking got too bad. Going to work felt like a bad acid trip, every day made me more and more jaded. 

Eventually I stopped showing up. The drinking got in the way. Even after days of not showing up they still begged me to come in. That’s how desperate they are for hands. I still feel horrible. I was making so much money, and making a difference in people’s lives, but it wasn’t worth feeling like that everyday. I feel like my mind has been raped. It’s been violated. I can’t look at life or death the same anymore. 

The worst part is I truly thought this field was my calling, I really enjoyed helping people. It sucks. Now I am all alone in another state blowing through my savings and barely making ends meet.

Just beer and wine coolers at first. Then by 15 I found the love of my life, vodka. I was mostly drinking with friends and occasionally a little bit with my family. 

Well my aunt cannot have natural children and met a surrogate and somehow it worked out to where the surrogate lived with my family (mom, step dad, me & siblings). Well my sister and I secretly caught my aunt’s surrogate having sex with my step dad. We confronted her alone and told her that she needed to move out and that we were going to tell our mom. She swore it was a mistake and a one time thing and said that if we told anyone it would ruin things for my aunt and end my moms marriage...... and then she bribed us. She offered us weed and alcohol to keep our family together. And we took it. I was never a big smoker so my sister got weed from her and I got like 12 handles of shitty vodka that we poured into water bottles. I swear it was almost 2 cases of water bottles that were really vodka. 

And that’s when I started drinking alone right around when I turned 16. I would sit in my room after school or on the weekends, sip on vodka, and play video games. I always had vodka and when I eventually ran out, I contacted that woman and she hooked me up as she stayed a good family friend. My mom wasn’t around much, my step dad got arrested, and I had the booze. My few close friends loved coming to my house and just getting fucked up for no reason. Eventually my sister was ridden with guilt and told my mom what happened over a year later and well that was a dark time for everyone and it cut off my free booze supply.

Baby Days,34,kx32k5,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kx32k5/baby_days/,30,"Shitpost time!

My habit started with PBR, I'd con my mom into buying me those 24-packs of the tallboys before I was 21 and it kind of snowballed from there, it's actually quite cute to think about now haha.

I live in the north and my town is a bunch of masochists that like to throw an outdoor event in the dead of winter downtown, live music, ice sculptures, some years they build an ice castle, it is actually pretty cool if you can brave the cold. It helps a little during the post-holiday bummer season. For some strange reason it's been canceled this year, wtf?

About five years ago I was working downtown, always the closing shift so made a plan with my brother to meet up at the carnival when I got off one night. This particular year the event was being sponsored by PBR and they were selling it cheap even when you consider that it is pretty much just swill. I was newly 21, an angsty barista and very much looking forward to purchasing my first legal drink at the winter carnival! Like holy shit! I'm an adult!

So I walked over there and found my way to the beer booth while I was waiting for little bro to show. It was actually pretty cool, the counter was a giant block of ice, but I don't envy the poor vendors haha. I don't quite remember my reasoning behind it, I think I was just anxious and didn't want to come back but I bought two PBR tallboys at once, I think there was a two-per limit. This done I felt kind of silly walking around double-fisting shitty beer in public so started to head to the edge of the park to sit on a wall, there were a lot of people around and I thought well I can just blend in.

I notice this man starts following me, going ""miss!"" Like I said I was anxious and still had remnants of big stranger danger fear back in those days. I thought he was drunk and perhaps wanted me to share my beer with him. I start going faster and he continues to follow me until I turn around and go ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He was a cop, just trying to let me know I couldn't leave the park with my alcohol hahaha. To be fair he was in plainclothes but he looked so pissed. It is very funny to think about now. It would not be the last time I yelled at a cop. I am very badass, you know. It has nothing to do with me being total trash.

Anyway it was all fine, I went and sat on the wall and drank my beers and hung out with my brother when he showed up. I distinctly remember going home on the bus with him pretty buzzed. To me that's the most amazing part of this boring ass story, that used to be all it took, two PBRs. How far we fall.

Taper and Work,37,kwng29,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kwng29/taper_and_work/,27,"Just found a shitty hand written resume spanning from ages 16 to 28. I'm currently a little more than 30 and a half years old.  Tallying up what was written and what my pickled mind could remember of the jobs I'd overlooked and trying to piece together my various employment after the resume, I'm astonished to find I've been employed approximately 43 different times since my very first job in highschool. 

Mind you, a few of these jobs were repeated at different times, many were one-off gigs, some were just a week or two, one I held for 3 years, one for 10 months, another for 4, and in 2019 especially I was working 3 jobs at once from April till December. 2020 brought the lockdowns and still I worked a few jobs, eventually landing the one I'm at now. 

I don't say this to brag. It's a cathartic thing really. Like, fuck! How have I not managed to save any money? To maintain my own transportation? That's rhetorical of course. As soon as my rent and bills are paid the majority of it goes to my liver, my nose, my stomach, (ears when concerts were a thing), jail fines for PI, overdraft fees for cutting it too close on benders, etc etc etc.

*“One way of dealing with a new lockdown is to look at the dark, acknowledge it, allow the difficulty of it and then intentionally turn your attention to the light,” she says...* 

*“Be curious. Have the best day you can have today... And, at the end of the day, let yourself know the small wins can be a delicious cup of coffee.” 😏*

*In other words, she says, preserve your sanity by keeping your expectations spectacularly low. Resist the compulsion to put deadlines on every aspect of your life. Fighting to put a timeline on things will only make you abject with misery when they fail to materialise. Hence this week’s words of upliftment are: surrender to the suck. “The paradoxical theory of change,” argues Samuel, “means that the more you accept the things you don’t want, the more you’ll be able to live with them.”*

Average day pt. 2,183,kw5ikt,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kw5ikt/average_day_pt_2/,21,"



The feel of a sweat soaked blanket and my headace make me realize that im awake now. My eyes are glued together, it takes some real effort to open them. When the blurriness settles down, I try to asses the damage.

Bedroom looks normal, bucket is empty, blanket only wet from sweat and there is not a scent of shit in the air. Goddamm im almost proud of myself.

Getting out of bed feels like an impossible task and my mission is to postpone it as long as possible. Its no use, my bladder feels like its about to explode. 

Removing the blanket from my body seems like an invitation for the anxiety demons, they are lined up quite nicely and now that the club is open, the bouncer is letting them in, one by one.

As I slighty swerve from right to left to the bathroom, my shoulder hits the door, another bruise for the collection. 

As if my body knew that I entered the bathroom, my bowels are trying to tell me something. I kneel before the toilet and prepare myself for pain and disgust. 

I usually enjoy throwing up, it feels relieving, not with a headace though. As a warm up my body decides to do a couple of dry heaves. Its no relieve when nothing but bile is coming out. My teeth feel like they bath in acid. Im afraid that with every heave my eyeballs will pop out of their sockets. The pressure in my head is unfathomably, I asked myself if anybody ever died from puking too hard, what a shitty way to die. 

It stopped, for now.

Taking turns now, instead of my face it is my ass now greeting the toilet. Like a fully pumped super soaker, liquid starts squirting out of my asshole. What a relieve.

As I cant bear my hangover existence, I stumble to the fridge. Only a few items are in it and only one of them are of interest. I grab the vodka and take a big sip. 
Normally a big sip is a good feeling.
Not this time.
That sip just told me, the bottle is almost empty.

Knowing this, it sparked a battle in my head. 

Dont buy new alcohol!
You dont want to go on another bender!
Remember what happened last time?
I guess I just buy some beers to taper...
No, Fuck that. No alcohol today!
My mind is racing with thoughts.

As I finished my thought process, the cashier asked me ""cash or credit?""

Cash, I take the bottle of vodka and leave the store.


Chairs fuckers.

The right time of night,119,kw6igt,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kw6igt/the_right_time_of_night/,18,"I think there is an argument to be made that the best hours of the day, for a drinker on the crippling side of functional, are 2-4 am.  Now, they aren't the best because they are convenient, or comfortable, or even fun. They are best hours of the day because they are *quiet*. The world is asleep, the bars are closed, and it's finally quiet.

Of course, by then, if you have a typical schedule (off work in the early evening, for example) you've already been able to slosh your brain down the river a fair ways. No matter what you've spent the evening doing, it is closing time, which means it's your time. No one to check for you, no one to find.

It's a wistful hour, romantic almost. I recommend finding a high perch - an upper story window, a hill, a parking garage, a roof. Looking down on the world while it sleeps in sober peace, while it passes along below you, without you. It has forgotten you; you, maybe, can forget about it. You're here, and they can't find you. You don't *really* want to be found, but part of you wishes someone would look.

My mind always feels most lucid in those moments, at least when I can remember what I was thinking about. Sitting in the warm, embryonic embrace of the booze, awash. I can drink exactly how I want there. Both oblivious and fully aware of the coming pain. Comfortable, and alone, finally, in the stillness of the night nearly gone.

Hell, I've actually been forcibly pegged by one of our fellow redditors. Kinda turned me off the whole idea, and oddly enough her reddit account has been dead ever since.

This time though, was apparently much gentler and involved even more alcohol, somehow. I don't remember it at all, but I was told about it at a later private moment when she offered to do it again. 

No clue what she was talking about, but it was explained to me that while drunk masturbating, I might have asked for help, and as a joke a digit slipped. I think this was meant to discourage my advances, but it seems drunk me was totally down.

Also, rumor has it that drunk me has quite the loose bootyhole.

Duality,91,kvg1nb,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kvg1nb/duality/,25,"I think part of the reason I drink is because I don't know who the fuck I am. When I was younger I used to struggle with whether I was a good person who did bad things, or a bad person who did good things. I separated my sober self with my drug self. My sober self was the good one who did bad things. My drug self was the bad guy who did good things.

Eventually I settled on being a person who does either good or bad things depending on the situation at the time, ultimately they are the same person.

Now I don't know again. Do I want to be sober? Hell naw. Do I want to continue down this path? Idk, I don't see other options. I've been some type of addict over half my life, this is all I know.

Every day I feel like a different person. I don't know how I'm guna wake up. It's tiring. On an hour to hour basis, I don't know how I'll be. Everything is black or white. There is no inbetween, no grey areas. It's all or nothing. I can't deal with uncertainty or the middle ground. Full on addiction or full on sobriety.

The doctor told me they gave me a bunch of staples. I asked if I had come from my apartment but realized after checking my phone I had gone to the bar on my block after getting pissed off due to an encounter I had with someone (never a good idea), and was already slammed when I got there (had been drinking for a long time at this point). Don’t remember much except befriending a girl and lots of vodka. Apparently I had fallen down and hit my head and cracked it open, and there was so much blood that they called 911, and I’m pretty sure I knocked myself out for a bit. The girl from the bar told me there’s much more to the story than that but honestly I may not want to know or hear it. When given my clothes back at the hospital (that they had to cut off), they were soaked  in blood. The only interaction I remember after that is begging the EMTs to let me have a cig before they took me, to which I was given a flat no, and getting pissed about calling them with the price of the ambulance ride. 

Apparently my BAC was a .35. I got discharged from the hospital at 8 am and took an Uber to my apartment, where my dad was picking me up at 10:30 (plans made before this), because I’ve been staying with them primarily since my last bender. 

Was just convincing everyone I was getting my shit together from my last bender, and gaining trust, and now I have to (but have yet to) explain my hospital trip to them because of the fees and insurance, that occurred on the one night I stayed at my apartment alone.

I’m also heavily concussed so I’m trying not to drink but I’m starting to feel very, very shitty. The only things helping are my cat, Kratom, and knowing I have emergency booze hidden around the place in case it gets too bad.

Went to the ER to get it checked out anyway. I was there for four hours. But lo and behold, they said my concussion was very mild and I was fine. Even cleared to drive. And I felt amazing. My main issue was neck pain from whiplash and stomach pain (probably not from the concussion though)

The definition of insanity,32,ksxata,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/ksxata/the_definition_of_insanity/,8,"
Tonight, for a brief moment, I allowed myself to sink into nostalgia. The memories of frequenting my local bar came flooding back, as I contemplated pouring another double shot, while simultaneously pawing at a cold beer hiding toward the back of my fridge. 

I lost track of how many times I played a little game at the bar. The game? 
Let’s say that it was a quirky, flirtatious type of mind game that I played dangerously with myself, for myself. It went something like this: 

I would stroll into the bar, anytime between 7-9pm. It would be one of a handful of bars within, at most, a 15 minute walk from my place. Needless to say, there were so many bars to choose from, but I knew to which ones I belonged. 

In tonight’s particular memory, I’m sitting at the bar. I’m friendly with a couple of the bar tenders. They’re cute, young and attractive, most likely live in Brooklyn and ride their single speeds across the river. 

I start my night by ordering a Brooklyn lager. Two or three conversations later, I will have moved on to a double whisky. I’ll pretend that it’s a little on the stronger side and the bartender will play along by serving me another Brooklyn beer to lessen the sting. 

Of course, not a moment too soon, I’ll down that whiskey and feign that brevity is the way of this land. Afterward, I’ll defiantly exclaim, ‘ that wasn’t so bad! I’ll have another double, please.’
Just like that, I’ll start to make small talk and suppress fears of inevitable consequences. 

I tell myself that the beers slow my intake. 

Periodically, someone connects with me and offers a drink which I wholeheartedly accept. There’s always a Brooklyn beer, as a backup - a prop of how measured I really am. At least that’s my train of thought. 

This reminds me that, during these escapades, I began setting alarms on my phone that would go off at exactly 11:40 pm - That way I would have time to get home, shower, and sleep at least 6 hours. 

I recalled all of this in an instant. I existed in two different dimensions at once. In various states of happiness and sadness, I suppose. 

Tonight, I tried to exhibit some semblance of self control or discipline. I used beer to slow dow the hard liquor intake.  

If only I could recall the moment that I stopped being able to follow through.",1610117928

Situation is critical, finished the vodka, only one nugget left and 2 beers. The only problem is I need to wait inside all day for a courier cos the fuckin' NHS randomly sent me a Covid test to see how widespread it is. I don't have Covid so it's pointless but I'll do my civic duty. Also it meant waking up at 7:30am to do the swab, after which I rewarded myself with vodka, so I didn't mind too much. It was bullshit, how the fuck do they expect me to origami a flat piece of cardboard into a box in the morning when I'm still drunk? It's held together with tape because I got frustrated as shit.

I always was a troubled kid. Psychiatry at 17 cause of suicide attempt and shit like that. I have been drinking since 12.

I recently decided to stop drinking and use benzos to help with withdrawal. Am 35 now.

When I was five I was sexualally misused by the oncle of my best friend.

My sister was molested by my cousin at age five and to my eternal shame I did not believe her. 6 months later he stapled his father to dead.

I was not thinking about those things the last decades but now I do not have restless night anymore.

I wake up in terror und can't control myself from crying.

I know alcohol is not a solution but it kind of helped me to cope and continue living.

My wife is going to a weekly counselor but I despise that lady cause everything happens is automatically my fault.

Maybe not. I've only had a few beers tonight; the last I had stored in the cupboard. I made sure to leave like an hour between each drink and quaffed at least a Gatorade bottle full of ice water between each. I've had one or two each night this week, usually when I'm winding down before bed, just to take the edge off. As I finished off my last beer earlier I contemplated heading to the liquor store for more. *Nah, leave it,* my sensible voice said, *take one of her anti-depressants and just go to bed*. Then the not so sensible voice chimed in, *nah, might as well go to the liquor store now, you know you'll want some more later this week*. I thought I'd mull it over, smoke some cigarettes. I figured I'd just get bored, cave in to laziness and take one of the anti-depressants CA Girlfriend left and blissfully pass out. 

It's been a difficult week so far. I see what they mean in early recovery about boredom because man I have been fucking *bored*. It's like the volume is turned down on everything; food is bland, music is boring, tv is unentertaining. So I prodded myself into keeping busy, as they recommend, to keep my mind off boozing for 'fun', or at least to bring some kind of meaning or feeling to the world. I felt so proud of myself the first day. I went out and bought some cheap hair clippers to finally tame the shitty mop that was my hairdo. It had gotten so bad I started wearing this floral baseball cap she left behind and I had hair sticking out behind and to the sides that just made me look like Forrest Gump in the running montage. 

I returned all the Christmas presents I'd bought for CA Girlfriend to get some Amazon credit. I felt a little sad, I can't lie, as I packaged them up to send back. I'd held off on opening the presents she'd bought me. They've been sat under the now-lopsided-and-still-up Christmas tree since mid December. It felt, I don't know, sacrilegious to open them without her there. But I opened them anyway. I laughed, somewhat bitterly, as I opened them, they were all perfunctory, the kind of utilitarian stuff your mom gets you; couple of pairs of jeans (neither of which fit), a jacket, and a hoody. I did appreciate the anchovy-stuffed olives she bought though. I didn't have as much a budget as she did so I tried to find stuff that had meaning, or that she'd find fun. I imagined us exchanging gifts on Christmas morning, if we hadn't been drunk. She'd say she felt the gifts she bought me were inadequate and she'd ""make it up to"" me. I'd just wave it off and tell her I was glad she enjoyed them. 


The calls and the texts have dried up from CA Girlfriend. Not sure what's going on with her. Normally when she drinks and we're away from each other she'll call me like multiple times an hour and leave rambling voicemails for me. I haven't been responding to any text or calls or Facebook messages she sends. She left me a voicemail earlier this week, telling me she still loves me and she wants to make it work but if I'm ""not willing to try"" she doesn't see the point. I don't understand what she's talking about. She's in New York living at her Rapey Ex's house, does she still think we're a couple or something? I try not to think about her much, but I was never very good with that kind of mental discipline. More often than not my mind just slinks back to her and I get angry or sad or stressed. I post memes on Facebook on the daily and sometimes she'll comment ""please talk to me"" or something along those lines. I just delete her comments. Not sure how I want to wrap this up yet but something's telling me to hold out on the whole delete + block. We'll see.


The job search has been pretty depressing. I thought employment agencies might be my salvation, they'd always gotten just-in-the-nick-of-time jobs in England, but the ones here have maybe a handful of jobs I'm qualified for. So I've spent my daytime hours sat in front of my laptop firing off job app after job app. I did get one offer. Not exactly a personalized offer, more like ""we saw your resume on Indeed and this might be a good job for you."" Call center work. Something I swore I'd never do again. I know I have to have the attitude of taking anything that's available, but I know call center work would send me swan-diving back into the arms of day drinking. I don't do confrontation. I'm not a confrontational person. I've never enjoyed call center work where your day basically consists of being screamed at for 8 hours a day. The last call center job I had was in England, where I worked for a stock broker. I well and truly learned the meaning of ""more money than sense"" dealing with people who had millions of pounds worth of shares but couldn't understand simple concepts like session times and auto logouts on our website. I started bringing pre-made mixers to drink at my desk just to cope. I'm not ruling out this job, but it's bottom of the pile. If the nature of the work wasn't bad enough I did some number crunching based on the hours offered and wage and after paying my rent and bills I would have around $50 left for the month. I decided to take your guys' advice and just put that rehab job down, hopefully it puts some plus points on my employability.

After a while pondering which one of her antidepressants to take, the not so sensible voice won out. I got changed and decided to hoof it down to the liquor store. When I got there there was a crowd in front of the doors. I slowed down and considered maybe turning around, or hanging around out of the way. I momentarily wondered if this was some MAGA crowd looking to start shit or something, inspired by the day's events. *Oh, well*, I thought, *they've seen you now*. I decided to just play it cool and pretend I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Walk casually. There were all sorts of people milling around outside; obvious homeless-looking types, cracked out looking types, I even walked past a couple who wore matching plaid shirts and appeared to have at least one matching tattoo visible on their necks. I can't see any activity in the store and I'm wondering why all these people are just stood outside. I get to the door and reach to grab the door handle when I notice a sign on the glass door saying the clerk will be back momentarily. I wonder if I looked like a bit of a dick just walking past everyone to try and open the door. I try to look nonchalant when I see this punk rock-looking dude talking to what looks like a lost house wife and chime into what he's saying, ""...they're told not to go after anyone, but at a 7-11 they're *encouraged* to go after thieves because they're privately owned, so if anything gets stolen the owners are the ones losing the money..."" Ah, ok. So the place was robbed. Again. 

The clerk finally appears out of nowhere from within the store to unlock the doors. Tattooed Biker Guy. He has old, full sleeve, tattoos; tacky (imho) skull tattoos on his knuckles. Always wears shades at night. But he's one of the friendliest clerks there. Always has a smile on his face and seems genuine when he asks how you're doing. Also never asks me for ID. I don't begrudge getting ID'd, I know they're just doing their job, but when I've been in your store every night for the last two weeks, wearing the exact same clothes it seems more than just a little bit surreal when the same clerks ask me for ID multiple times.


I get home and slam down a beer perhaps faster than I should have. Plans? I don't know. I'm not worried about day-drinking, so that won't cut into the job search, I hope. I know I'll hate myself in the morning for drinking so much. I should probably clean the fridge. There's food in there from the beginning of December that's undoubtedly liquefied or given host to new lifeforms by now. I feel guilty about that. I was from the ""there's starving children in Africa"" generation; it galls me there's so much food in there that's just gone to waste. One step at a time or some shit. Last drink before bed.

Hi. I come visit here every once in a while. I live next to a liquor store. I am moving. I wanna talk.,189,kruh0p,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kruh0p/hi_i_come_visit_here_every_once_in_a_while_i_live/,60,"Hi. I (28F) wanna tell my story. 

So I think my last post here was losing the same job a second time this year, something that happened as a direct result of drinking both times; the second time being late-October. Frankly, I don’t really feel bad about losing the job and should never have been offered it back in the first place lol, but they begged and pleaded with me for months and unemployment dried up so there I ended back again... 

That job was a huge contributor to my drinking problem. Like, huge. I’ve manifested several things in my life that led me to the point of having a drinking problem, but working at a bar where bartenders are encouraged to drink on and off shift and working alongside a boss who is a raging alcoholic herself was a big part of the way things escalated for me. 

Another contributing factor was quarantine, just like everyone else. All of a sudden I couldn’t go visit my at-risk parents because the people in my office (I worked two jobs for most of 2020) didn’t even believe the virus was real. Me, knowing the virus is real, basically sat my ass in my apartment for a few months. The people in my office at the time drank a lot too (and yes- this is not even the bar job I was referring to- it was a freaking 9-5 desk job in insurance) and I would just come home and drink some more. I was alone constantly other than with work people. 

You see, I live next to a liquor store. Like can see it from my bedroom window lol. So when I wanna binge, it’s very very easy for me to do so. Eventually I came totally clean- told the insurance gig about my drinking problem after going through severe withdrawal after a 4-day bender; I quit, quarantined for two weeks, and went back to my parents. 

Little side note - no one believed I had a drinking problem that resulted in alcohol withdrawals except my parents. Literally you guys— *everyone* at work thought I was trying to cover up a pill problem. It was highly irritating because frankly there was a lot of shame in me coming clean and then these assholes thought I was lying still lmao. As if I thought alcohol withdrawals were a better look.... like bro, I would have just claimed stomach flu and “it’s not gonna work out” and dipped out. Anyway. 

I am pretty realistic about the problem I have. Obviously like most kinds of alcoholics I am worse when I isolate. So going back to my parents’ house and having someone hold me accountable really helped — I didn’t stop drinking, but I seriously laid off. I might have a seltzer or two a day on a slow day or five on a busy day. I didn’t touch liquor. I smoked a lot of weed. I didn’t feel at risk of life-threatening withdrawal at all. I was there for around three months while still maintaining my own empty apartment. 

They moved away in September. I ended up back here in my apartment next to the liquor store. No family nearby to speak of. I ended up meeting a guy who I still really, really, really love, and whose presence kept me accountable to someone and to some extent. But the last couple of weeks as he’s been absent more, I have started to go downhill again. It’s easy to do alone. 

Bored? Liquor store. Alone? Liquor store. I deliberately only buy single shots or double shots at a time, but it is waaaaaay too easy to just keep meandering back over there. I was probably hitting eight shots of fireball in a day at my highest recently. And I’m escalating and I know that. 

I had a full-time job lined up. A job that seemed like it would be dope. This should have started Tuesday and I was supposed to go for my physical on Monday. 

Wanna hear one of the most CA things ever? I am fairly positive I full-on threw away my car keys lol. So as I was leaving for my physical— I realize my car keys are not in my apartment. I don’t have a spare. 

I call a locksmith, I call the new job and tell them I’ll be late for the physical which I know is a bad look from the get (although I just had to get there by 4:00 pm and this was at around 11:00 am, still embarrassed though because I had said I would be there at “x” time much closer to 11:00 am). 

The locksmith tries and fails to cut my key for over an hour. They took forever to arrive in the first place and by then we are approaching 3:00 pm. This new job is thirty minutes away from me. This dude has tried to cut a simple car key SIX different times. I’m like what kind of job is gonna believe this shit?! It was true though. 

In short... I took it as a sign. I didn’t even walk into my apartment as I told the locksmith to please leave. I walked directly across the way to the leasing manager and told her that since my lease is up in February, that I wanted out.

I’m moving back to be with my parents over 1000 miles away, closer to my hometown, closer to other friends and other family. People who I have known since I was a kid who I have to be accountable around. I can’t control myself here alone and I know that. At least with them, someone will be there when I get home. I cannot full-on throw myself into a bender without someone noticing. There is no liquor store next to their home. I will not be a single 28 year old female living alone for 1.2k/month (that’s all my bills combined yes - and with an ailing vehicle so that price is going up) on like a 2k/month income. 

I can feel myself approaching that low point again. I am trying to make positive change. 

So... hi. My name is Samantha. I move back in with my parents in about 30 days. I just turned 28 years old, and my health matters. I have trouble being alone. I fall in love fast. I am impulsive. I have a serious drinking problem. I am sure my struggle isn’t over so I’m not gonna sit here and be like, “Hey guys I’m SOBER from alcohol now!!!” I’m not even currently and I won’t be for a while. But this move is a good step in the right direction to keep myself out of anymore serious danger. 

For now, yeah I got two shots of Fireball and I’m drinking a Miller High Life. I am going to taper from here on out and just stick with beer for a week/less/whatever I have to. I welcome taper suggestions, but will google on my own as well. 

And tbh, and on my last note ... I love this man I have been seeing. I want to make him proud of me. He wants me to be happy. I want to be happy. I want him to be happy. I want the same for all of you. Reach out to people who love you or strangers on the internet, none of us are alone.

EDIT: A RELATEABLE QUOTE FROM THIS MASTERPIECE:  
 

“One fast more or I'm gone', I realize, gone the way of the last three years of drunken hopelessness which is a physical and spiritual and metaphysical hopelessness you can't learn in school no matter how many books on existentialism or pessimism you read, or how many jugs of vision-producing Ayahuasca you drink, or Mescaline you take, or Peyote goop up with-- That feeling when you wake up with the delirium tremens with the fear of eerie death dripping from your ears like those special heavy cobwebs spiders weave in the hot countries, the feeling of being a bent back mudman monster groaning underground in hot steaming mud pulling a long hot burden nowhere, the feeling of standing ankledeep in hot boiled pork blood, ugh, of being up to your waist in a giant pan of greasy brown dishwater not a trace of suds left in it--The face of yourself you see in the mirror with its expression of unbearable anguish so hagged and awful with sorrow you can't even cry for a thing so ugly, so lost, no connection whatever with early perfection and therefore nothing to connect with tears or anything: it's like William Seward Burroughs' 'Stranger' suddenly appearing in your place in the mirror- Enough! 'One fast move or I'm gone' so I jump up, do my headstand first to pump blood back into the hairy brain, take a shower in the hall, new T-shirt and socks and underwear, pack vigorously, hoist the rucksack and run out throwing the key on the desk and hit the cold street...I've got to escape or die...”

Into the void.,30,krpcl1,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/krpcl1/into_the_void/,34,"Jesus Christ, I was on the “yay! gonna get sober!” train for NYE and it all crumbled within less than a week. I had an extensive internal debate with myself when I went to the supermarket to buy food today, and obviously the part of me which screamed “get some vodka in you, you stupid cunt, it’s the only release you’re getting in this world anyway” won over. Six days. Not too bad. 

And then I realised... I just don’t care anymore. I don’t give a fuck. If I die from this — well, I’m not even going to kid myself and pretend it matters. And if this is the only choice I can make, day after day, then that’s alright, because not all of us are destined for perfect lives in which we matter and people care about us and we feel motivated to get better because the future holds so much, so much potential — that is not me. I was a certified genius when I was young. The year I was preparing to enrol at uni, my headteacher asked “Oxford or Cambridge, which one would you like?” And I screwed it all up, because it’s what I always do. It’s the only thing I can do.

People pity me sometimes. I can feel it, recognise it in their stares. And I despise them for it. Even in this state, I am better than they could ever hope to be. Even with my crooked face I look astonishingly good. I am clever, talented, helpful, funny, and kind — and I am going to throw it all away. For this? For this. 

My best friend told me once, “You just don’t want it badly enough, because if you did, you’d find a way.” She wasn’t talking about sobriety, but “getting better” in general. And she was right. I don’t want it. Never have, never will. I am just one of those people — self destruction is not even second nature to me, it’s my first nature. And I will do what comes naturally to me, and see how far I get.

Life Pro Tip: don’t talk squirrel to your landlord,98,kr9r06,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/kr9r06/life_pro_tip_dont_talk_squirrel_to_your_landlord/,24,"So whenever I’m drinking, I’m convinced I can talk to squirrels. 

It began as this thing where they’d occasionally visit my patio to steal seeds out of my birdfeeder, but I’m *pretty* sure I’ve, like, learned how they communicate.

Whenever I see one, I can start making *their* sounds and – no shit – they drop whatever they’re doing, perk up, and listen to me. 

When I stop, they continue to stare at me as though asking “do you have any more to share?!”

For instance, they warn each other about predators, namely hawks, by doing a warning call, followed by sounds of where to find and be aware of said predator and the predator’s distance. The distance is marked by the number of sounds they make after the initial “hey, look out, guys!” call. It’s wholly recognizable.

Yeah so anywho.

I always hear squirrels on my patio. They make a very distinctive sound on the concrete topped by wooden fence that separates my apartment patio from the building behind me/us.

I hear tapping along this wooden paneling. It’s that exact distinctive sound of a squirrel. 

I’m in my master bathroom, whose window also has access to the patio, doing my business and I hear this. So I open my window and start speaking squirrel.

It goes/went something like [deep gutteral sound]: “Splach splach splach! Huh-bubba-ba. Huh-bubba-ba. Huh-bubba-ba.”

Was it a squirrel outside on my fence? No. No it was very much not. I opened my window and was speaking squirrel... but who was making those sounds? 

It was my goddamn landlord!

He gave me the sideye for what seemed like a full minute, but was likely 3 seconds but it was full-on “what. in. the. fucking. fuck?” side-eye.

Because I was caught so off guard, I couldn’t even explain I thought he was a squirrel. I was just like “sorry [landlord], thought you were someone else!” 

Because it’s obv normal to communicate [deep gutteral sound]: “Splach splach splach! Huh-bubba-ba. Huh-bubba-ba. Huh-bubba-ba,” to another human person. 

ANYWAY. If there’s any worthwhile TL;DR takeaway here, it’s “confirm who or what is outside your window  before you start making noises.” I’d normally end with some sarcastic “thanks for coming to my TED talk,” but I’m still so embarrassed by this, I WILL make this my TED talk if I ever get one.",1609915201

You guys gave me awards for being a useless piece of shit. Thank you. You think stupid internet things don’t matter and you just need a quick diary outlet to some randoms. But dammit. Why is my black pickled heart feeling warm?

A shitty shaky story I need to dump for cathartic reasons

TLDR, I tend to blather. Got fucked up New Years and New Year’s Day. Made an ass of myself. Pissed off SO. Thought I was dying for the 120th time. Bowels and heart took turns threatening me. Long time lurker under diff accounts. 

The New Year’s Eve plan: Beer, wine, beer, wine, water, champagne, bed. New Year’s Eve actual: wine, wine, wine, wine, lemon drops, pounded everyone’s mixed drinks, killed 2 bottles of merlot with a friend, fought with SO through the ball drop in front of friends, blacked out, cried incoherently, fought with another friend, kept drinking ...something... Woke up and pounded 9 mimosas by 2 pm New Year’s Day. Took two shots of vodka. 

I had a bad year. We all did. 2 deaths (one extremely close to me that rocked me. Lacked support through it.) I’ve been hard drinking for 10 years. A mix of shots, 2 bottles of wine, 12 pack and shots, a mix of all. Whatever is in front of me. I’m a tough girl. I don’t need a mixer. I’ll pound tequila and smile. 

I’m 9 mimosas in at 2pm and SO is driving me home. Friends are alcoholics. They didn’t judge my antics to my face. I’m singing, horribly, along to the car radio, songs of unjust treatment and pain. I’m so *fun*. We get home. “Let’s watch a movie, you need to sleep.” No. “Let’s take shots.” I take shots alone. This is going swimmingly. I’m blackout but coherent. I’m babbling angry, petulant nonsense at SO. I hear myself saying it. I’m being vile. I don’t stop. I pass out. If I go to bed by 8pm, I will be *fine* for work tomorrow. Everyone loves me. This is fine. 

Midnight. On the dot. To the second. I look at my phone. There was a boom, a clap, a flash of light, so loud it shook me.  SO is awake, staring at the ceiling. “What was *that?*” “What was what?” His voice is tired, sober, curt. I shrug in darkness. Must have been a firework, but if felt like it went off in my brain. 

“Please go back to sleep.” I’m *going*. Just gotta pee. Jesus. I feel warm, heady, am I still drunk? I stagger to the bathroom, feet don’t fail me now. I sit and dear god. How is it all the same consistency? The noises. The splashing. I am disgusting. I dry heave toward the wall but everything that wants out is leaving exit access ports only, and it’s not stopping. That’s when the first wave hits. A ball of flames around my heart. A wave of anxiety. I feel my scalp starting to sweat. This is bad. 

“Yuh aight?” I hear SO’s muffled voice, probably talking through the pillow. He can hear it. My ancestors can hear it. Jesus fucking Christ this is embarrassing. My god the waves of dread and fear. If I can just get to my weed in my dresser. I can still sleep this puppy off. I’m okay. No one hates me. This is fine. 

I stagger back to bed and a cold sweat has consumed me. It’s fucking freezing but I am the fire girl. “Plea try to slee.” I hear him grumble. Head buried in the pillow, hiding from the sounds and stench no doubt. I *am*.  I hit the weed, three times solid. This is *fine*.

Weed betrays me. More booms resonate between my ears. The anxiety kicks up ten fold. Fuck im ugly. I hate myself. Sweat pools in the corners of my eyes. My hair is like I’ve just showered. My feet kick slimily over each other. Can a human heart beat this fast and recover? Please god *please*. Should I take a shot? Will that kill me?

2 am. More weed. Bad idea. Bad fucking idea. Back to the throne, back to the stench and gagging, where I will die, where I will be found as the king himself, a commonality of death with a man who everyone doesn’t hate like they hate me. I can’t even fucking sing. 

I go back to bed without my pants. Too hot. SO is so far to the edge of the bed, a butterfly’s kiss could push him off. Fucking hell, I’m in trouble. I’m shaking, I’m shivering, I’m a human vibrator with a pulse stronger than a cheap dildo. The anxiety, my heart is a furnace. Help me. Help. Me. My skin is the cool claminess of person in their last 10 minutes, and I touched two this year. I know what it feels like. 

Boom. Clap. Sweat. Shudder. Boom. Someone is outside. I know they’re aren’t but I swear to god they are. This isn’t my first time sweating it out. This is not the first anxious party. But this was deeper. This was stronger. Each boom is a metaphorical hallucinated bullet that missed my heart. 

4-7 am are rinse, wash, repeat. Work was a shit show. I disassociated and took sips of soda and saltines to try to keep the blood sugar up or down, depending on the headache or shakiness level. 

I didn’t drink that night. Or the night after. I’ve slept maybe 6 hours total. I’m tired. I’m so fucking depressed. I’ll drink again soon, the only thing my daddy gave me was thick hair and alcoholism.

"Just watched Another Round, and you should too",39,krb6jj,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/krb6jj/just_watched_another_round_and_you_should_too/,38,"**Another Round (Druk)** is a film by Thomas Vinterberg about four middle-aged high school teachers who decide to test the social lubricant effects of alcohol in order to break out of the joyless ruts they seem to be stuck in, hoping they will reignite their youth and passion,  
  
  
They test a theory by Finn Skårderud who proposed that keeping BAC at 0.5 at all times is beneficial for social conduct, personal happiness, courage, inspiration and creativity,  
  
It goes in some unexpected and some expected ways but it is never boring, never uninspired and consistently beautiful,  
The topic is taken seriously but with much levity, which is, in my opinion, the only way to tell stories about substance use,  
  
It is a refreshing exploration of functional alcoholism, love, friendship, interpersonal relations and the will to live,  
  
A simple, poignant and realistic view of the human spirit and how alcohol affects it, a movie about drinking without melodrama and overacting, substance use without pharmacological determinism and extremity common to most movies about ""addiction"",  
Yes bad things happen, but beautiful things happen as well,  
    
Even though alcohol is the central theme of the film it never becomes the main protagonist, rather it works as a medium in order to tell a deeply humane story,      
  
The movie is in Danish so you fuckers better learn how to read subtitles, or learn Danish at least,  
  
Anyway, watch it, don't watch it, whatever, it's a beautiful film, one of the few drink/drug use movies I enjoyed, others being Trainspotting, Drugstore Cowboy, Fear and Loathing and Barfly, maybe there's others I like but can't think of any now,

Wanted to spit ball a CA-related question to you guys since I know some of you out there are holding down professional jobs and there's also a few sensible people here.

Couple of years ago I had a really good job working for the state healthcare provider at an inpatient rehab (lol). I wasn't there for very long, maybe around six months, and lost the job because I relapsed. I woke up like 5 hours late for my shift because I stupidly stayed up till 2 in the morning (I was supposed to wake up at 6 for work) shotgunning vodka until I passed out. 20+ missed calls from my boss and dozens of texts. I was done. I was too ashamed and embarrassed that I'd blown it and text my boss something like ""hey, sorry, I can't come into work. I have personal issues in my life I need to deal with. Take that as my resignation or fire me or whatever. Sorry.""

I never even entertained the idea of putting it on my resume. I figure if someone got in contact with them they'd say ""yeah, he worked here, he was drunk on the job and we fired him for a no show, no call."" 

I've been trying to spruce up my resume (I have a *lot* of gaps from homelessness) for these job apps I'm firing off and I was wondering if I should put the job down. Working for the state healthcare provider looks pretty good, and a two year employment gap looks better than an almost-three-year gap.

Instead of a whimsical fairytale adventure, waking up in Wonderland, mad, I woke up in an ambulance—apparently pretty angry.  I would have absolutely no awareness of this preposterous event if it weren't for the vanished mirror and the recounting from my poor family who cleaned it up after they found me out cold, contorted up amongst the shards.  Had they not, I would've come to, demented and WDing, reflexively rolled over in the glass, and cut myself up nice and good.  I'm lucky to have both my eyes and all my arteries because thin glass like that shatters into these menacing, dagger-like shards.  I *do* have a propensity for falling into/out of precarious places, but that would've been something.  A blood sacrifice for the Yuletide.  An offering for the meal that I didn't eat.  I probably should've eaten.

Of an old Indian woman playing dominoes with a chicken?”
- Malcolm Lowry, Under The Volcano

It isn’t the booze that is the problem. It is the panic that happens when it is not here. I am far more worried now (drunk) than I was, when I was not drunk and had an entire bottle. I think I would feel more comfortable if I had not drunk at all, and kept the bottle full. It’s the full bottle that keeps me sane, and the empty glass that ruins my brain. 

I have no idea what this post is about but I’m shitfaced and there are only a few millilitres left in the bottle. I’m panicking, I’m always panicking. I should buy in bigger quantities, but there will never be enough. One glass is too many, a hundred glasses is not enough. 

I’m watching a show called the queens gambit, and occasionally I feel like I am playing chess against my own alcoholism, like I try to make a move before he does.

Because somehow I know, one wrong move from me (that extra line, that message to a dealer, that extra bottle of jack), is one move in the devils favour. One wrong move from me, he takes my king, and they are doing an autopsy in the morning. I have to guess my own drunk moves, since in the game of my life I am forced to play both the angel and the devil. It seems black and white, but the pieces are all grey to me.

I was going to joke around saying “addiction” and what not but after I started reading some of the posts on this sub holy shit, stay fucking strong!!

My actual addiction though,

On Dec 27,2020 I threw my electronic single use e-cig at the ground, recorded it and told myself I wont touch nicotine for all of 2021 ever since that day.. Well, here we are 2 months and 11 days into the new year and I have stayed true to my goal. It’s been hard, I’ve caught myself many times, saying ” just one”, or “its social smoking” or “I should reward myself because I havent smoked in 2 months” but from how I see it this is just a desperate attempt of my brain trying to trick me into poisoning myself, again.  I started substituting the urge to smoke nicotine with marijuana (weed) . I’d go and smoke a joint, sometimes I’d smoke 2, 3, 4 in a day because it distracted me from the actual urge to smoke a cigarette or those super convenient single use nicotine electronics smh! 

Now I’ve started to take a step back from weed. It’s too nice, it makes me so calm, it makes me feel good mentally, motivated and so many other things I don’t get when I’m sober. Sounds great right? Wrong, this is exactly why it has become a problem. I used to say its harmless and make excuses for it, but now I’m starting to really understand that living a sober life is the hardest thing for me to do! I truly wish to feel “high off life” as people say and the only way to really feel that way is stop doing things that sugarcoat life for me, like weed does. I’m still at odds with myself about weed, sometimes it does more good than harm and thats why I’m having such a hard time completely cutting it out. 

I’m going to take a month long tolerance break, I’m only on day 2 of not smoking weed but I’m adamant about withholding for a month. I will give an update in a month, since I’m posting this on here, I pinky promise every single one of you that I wont be touching neither Weed or Nicotine until that post. 

Stay strong, Mental Health is Wealth :) <3",1615525811

I have been addicted to xanax before, I only took black out amounts that had me waking up in handcuffs or a hospital bed became homeless and bounced back and achieved things, just went through a rough breakup and move out, and did Meth for the second time in my life, instead of holding it until a friend came, I finished a gram in a night, not a good high, and the worst comedown ever. Did 3 days with 3 hours of sleep. Why do I make extremely destructive desicions over and over. Meth is not something I want to fuck around with. Especially with depression and a history of addiction yet ive done an ungodly amount. I hated it but how can I trust myself that I'm not going to do it again even though I don't like it. 

Deleted what I had written earlier as I was freaking out about the fact I had taken meth and scared I'd take it again. Ive been on meth comedown reading horror stories involving meth. I just cant believe the risks I'm taking with my impulsive nature. My goal is to be sober and claim the happiness I've had before sober. but it always seems like I'm one destructive desicion away from ruining my life. I just cant find motivation to get up out of bed and clean my room and do basic human things.  I can't imagine getting sober. But it's what I gotta do. I've got a job starting on Wednesday and I've made an appointment to start a mental health care plan. Last time starting a job pushed me, kept me occupied. So it'll either be bad timing with how I'm struggling or give me the push I need

I just want to know if I need to be actively seeking counselling about using meth from the 2 times and if I can be confident I won't use it again if I hate the high. Or is it common to say never again and then do it in 3 months then it's monthly, weekly ect ect. Much rather get on it early.

Below is what I originally posted a few hours ago, freaking out. I'm going to be dealing with pretty much no happiness for the next 4 days because of this comedown and at least it's made me see how evil this shit is. I'm gonna leave it there anyway

When I was 16/17 my life got turned around by a drug trafficking charge for selling weed to alot of people because it was deemed a business. wasn't locked up but was initially looking at 7 years this put so much stress on me while staying completely sober until I started fucking with xanax here and there always taking too many and waking up to really fucked consequences. It left me homeless and kicked out of my family home. Yet in that time when i couldn't use anyone to keep it going I had to change to survive and ended up getting a job, moving in with a partner, car, kitty and stayed sober for happily for quite a while. But we had a housemate who revealed to me he did meth, I gave in and tried some knowing how fucked it was but also seeing this guy function and seem pretty normal. It sped me up and just reminded me of when I'd snort Ritalin at school for exams and study. It seemed really dissapointing and definitely wasn't worth my earned money. I thought about it a few times and how once the doors open and you do it. Then it's easier for yourself to do again but it was pretty shit and then I watched that guy turm into a fucking lunatic crackhead in about 2 months so never thought about it again but also saw a good reminder of what I could become if I was using, he was 30, using for years apparently. Me and my partner broke up with a horrible ending. I lost my job due to lack of work and moved into a tiny room in student accommodation. I'll mention at this point I had been on anti depressants for a year but was fine when I was working, now im all alone and extremly depressed and never got out of bed. Knowing I needed to do things to be happy, missing my partner of 2 years ect. But gave it time and a couple weeks, got back into my gaming pc but also drinking too much some nights or on some occasion taking oxy or a xan when the feels hit. I managed to identify that as I did drug counselling for it last time and learnt alot about being happy naturally without being the chemists of our brain and taking the bad in, and I didn't want to end up like I did last time because I had started to reconnect strongly with family and friends again. So I managed to stop it and limit drinking to socially. I still struggled and couldn't do the things I knew I had to and wanted to, to be happy like excersizing or even smaller things like cleaning my room which was full of old beer bottles. The breakup passed though but still felt same and thought to myself that I needed purpose to bring me out of this, and a job really helped me push through, be sober, be busy. But I had no luck and alot of cash, my childhood friend I experimented every drug with lost his job and I found myself at his house, doing Md, acid. Hating it and just wanting to be a real hard working person, waking up and not having the motivation to be that person. And then he discovered he had a few hundred in bitcoin that had been laying around. We got drunk and decided we would buy high quality coke but just short on funds, settled for a gram of clean meth. This was only 5 days ago but looking back I just sat, waiting for it excited because I told myself I'd take a tiny bump and clean my filthy room and car, like I had nothing else to be excited about. Like a fucking junkie that wasn't addicted yet. I was gonna meet up with my friend at mine on the Friday and we were both going to try a nice clean high and experience it since we had both tried it once, and found it to be weak and didnt have enough to get us high, we could surely get enough to get fucked. I took my bump, felt shit all, and kept taking more, I didn't want to clean my room at that point, I wanted to get high as fuck, I started smoking it out of foil, which as a novice wasted tons. and just like that between 4pm that afternoon and 4am the next morning, I smoked and snorted a gram of meth. I still found the ""rush"" and general high to be still dogshit   it felt like when I first tried it just a tiny euphoria and very speedy. It was pretty much intense Ritalin. Which isn't fun to me, so I'm sitting in my room, sweating, uncomfortable, really speedy, writing essays at 4am about my own problems.I hated the high and hated myself. Just typing about my fuckups. And at about 8am yesterday the high slowed down and I started Realising what I'd just done, one of the worst fucking drugs alone in my room, why? The drug that could take ruin any chance of a future, knowing I have a history of dependency with xans, I started looking at how I had just been making excuses to clean to just abuse and ignore what i was about to do. And then the worst comedown I could ever imagine hit me. I knew meth comedown was bad but I didn't imagine this feeling, I looked up how bad it really is and that people get suicidal thoughts. I started wondering if I should maybe go to hospital in fear that I would end up having suicidal thoughts. But I told myself that I should endure this pain, that felt like I was dying, like my soul was void of any happiness. So I could just hate the drug, and I did. I had to tell my friend that it was all gone. He was so pissed and went on to tell me that he wants to use meth because he can control it. Saying I need to buy him more but I started to realise how evil this shit is. I thought he was talking like an addict.i took pride knowing that i can at least know that you can't control this shit. Your not special. But I was the one that just did it all helplessly so it's almost like I'm trying to make an excuse for myself in thinking I can spot the signs. Its just horrid. He wanted to buy him more. But feeling this, I couldn't buy him more after experiencing that loss of control. We can't do this shit and I told him we can't be friends if it's based around drugs and fueling each other.  And that we have to cut out any ties to this out of our lives. I went on and on, crawled into a ball. Shaking my leg all day as it got worse and worse and here I am now. It started on Tuesday and it's late Thursday night. I didn't sleep for 48 hours and then had 3 hours of sleep. Ate one meal. And just got to look at myself as a drug addict in pain.I still feel lost, not knowing when the comedown will end. Ive been reading about how bad this shit is. I haven't wanted more to feel better, I just want to get through it. And I don't know if I can say never again and that I can take this a lesson to start seeking professional help instead of letting myself hit rock bottom, and I'd kill myself rather then this drug take me to where it takes others. I don't know if I can make those judgements, now, only 2 and a bit days since I took it or if that's just something I'm telling myself for now. But during the comedown, I had a text back from a guy I met weeks ago about a job, offering me full time hard labour starting next Wednesday. Its Thursday and I'm still a mess. I've booked a doctors appointment to get a referral to see a psychologist tommorow. I have time to get ready and maybe make steps towards myself. So I'll be asleep soon. But I'm scared, and I should be. I don't ever want this drug again but I just took it after saying that the first time. Can anybody give me any advice. Am I at great risk?  Am I gonna end up wanting it again even though it was just pain. I feel at risk of slipping into benzos but not this shit, not no sleep and going insane. How far am i along on becoming an active user of this shit. Because it seems like everyone ends up picking it up again. What solid steps can I make to ensure it doesn't happen. I don't even know any street dealers anywhere with it. But If i put in effort I'm sure it's not hard to find. And how can I just put a lock on drugs away for good. Ive only just realised in the previous months that they're not fun and make life worse. If someone could help it would mean alot. Am I overestimating its power? I have a history of taking excessive amounts and it just doesn't seem like the shit I should mess with. I feel like I've got alot of potential without drugs, but with them I could end up a junkie. Most importantly is it possible to get away with just this as a lesson or do I need to make serious steps to make sure I don't ever try it again.",1615496653

Today will be my first day sober from drugs,80,m1z006,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1z006/today_will_be_my_first_day_sober_from_drugs/,20,"(I tried using a throwaway to post this but it got shadowbanned instantly so fuck it, I'll post this on my main)

I've been sober for stretches of days before but I feel like my usage has gotten way out of hand lately.

For the past ~3 weeks I've taken benzos nearly daily and have smoked weed every single day, sometimes getting high right as I wake up.

I've tried nearly every drug available to me. 27 different substances, including meth, xanax, cocaine, etc.

I can't stop using when I've got drugs at home unless they're psychedelics. If I've got weed, I'll smoke it and if I've got benzos I'll take them. Every single day until I run out.

I don't know why I'm like this.

I had major problems with mdma abuse about 2 years ago and my brain might be fried forever. I can't feel love, still, and I lack empathy.

I've done so much fucked up shit to hurt other people and the memories keep invading my mind every time I'm sober. And I'm only 19.

So many of my relationships with other people have been fucked up because of drugs. Sometimes I feel like my friends treat me differently because of my drug usage.

This time I lost someone I cared about because I was high on clonazepam and carts 24/7. They said they were scared for me and that they've got too many of their own problems to also deal with mine. Basically, I'm a burden.

I just hope that this time I've got the strength to bear the hell that sobriety opens up for me.",1615416190

"Starting my journey, need advice",1,m2hu9i,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m2hu9i/starting_my_journey_need_advice/,3,"To keep this as short as possible I have had a very negative and dependant relationship with weed for the past 8 years and started drinking/became a pretty bad alcoholic in this past year alone. I realize how much these two substances are holding me back, with the weed it was more transient, but with the alcohol, it's right in my face and so linked to smoking pot at this point that I need to stop them both entirely. 

This brings me to my question. Around 4 years ago I got pretty hooked on cigs in college, switched to vaping over the past 2 years, and had roughly 4 months nicotine-free as of today.  Now today I woke up with a very determined mindset to avoid both alcohol and pot but found that midway through the day I was having such intense bursts of anger/sadness, self-destructive thoughts, etc. I caved and bought a pack of cigs, smoked around 3 or 4 of them, and then decided that I would just buy a vape to hold me over for these first few months of abstinence. 

I'm now in a weird spot where I am motivated and had a great first day of no pot/booze, but I also feel like I failed massively by relapsing on something I hadn't used in months. In my mind, the daily alcohol and weed will be infinitely more destructive long term than a few months of vaping to help get off of it but another part of me recognizes that by doing this I've rationalized myself into using a new drug to cope and am not facing any of the addictive tendencies that put me here.

I appreciate any thoughts or advice on this in advance and hope everyone is doing well in their journey!",1615466009

It's like I only use them when I feel like I have to do things that ""don't align with my truth"" so to speak. 

My biggest trigger is money / career choices. Looking for office jobs makes me wanna get high. Then, for while I was completely sober, working out a lot and feeling strong - I got a model job out of nowhere. Didn't even apply for it. I had no wish to use drugs at the time because the job was somehing I was passionate about.

Now I've had two office work job offers and what have I done? I got so high the night before I didn't make it to the job interview. I thought about those jobs a lot, tried to convince myself I could like them. But honestly? I don't like them. I'm not excited about them.

It's just that everybody says how hard it is to get jobs and money is so important - yes, money is important. But if I do a job that makes me unhappy, guess where the money goes? To drugs.

Whenever I've had a ""meh"" feeling about a job, it turned out to be not right for me. I'm in such an inner struggle. It's hard to decline offers but at the same time I believe - If it don't feel right, it ain't right. Better things come along, I just have to stop dwelling on whether I made the right decision or not. 

I'm looking for validation honestly. It's not that I'm afraid of the challenges of the office jobs - it's just: The only reason I would do them is for the money which isn't even that much. I don't see myself being inspired or growing in those environments.

Why don't I do model jobs or something like that? Actually that was just a conincidence, I'm not at an agency or something. I'm looking for jobs as a working student. 

If I had really wanted to, I could have made to those job interviews. It's like I was hoping they reject me so I don't have to reject them. I'm missing guidance. People so easily say ""just do the job for the money"" but it's more than that - it's your lifetime and your energy. You can always quit but would you have the guts to quit on the spot or after a month?

TLDR: Job search and office/working student jobs as well as writing my bachelor thesis make me wanna do drugs. But everyone says I should do those things (without the drugs). I feel trapped.",1615413591

Ritalin, 5 mg twice a day, worked just fine at first. Then something happened, set me off and I started taking a lot more. Started snorting them. Started taking Benzos and even cocaine and drinking again.

Cocaine is the worst. Doesn't help you focus, you're just completely off the rails. I make the dumbest decisions on cocaine and then it leaves me feeling like ""meh"" and ""What have I done?"".

But, dude, I've tried so hard, my brain is a fog without a stimulant. Maybe I do have ADHD? Or I'm just not living right. I'm lacking social support as well. I don't even like cocaine and alcohol. Ritalin has helped me though. 

Yeah I feel at a loss. My therapist doesn't help me either. At all.",1615415045
a little hope & faith for all you who are suffering right now - remember: you got this.,2,m23hnz,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m23hnz/a_little_hope_faith_for_all_you_who_are_suffering/,0,"instead of posting a link to my blog like i'm trying to collect hits, i just copied and pasted this excerpt because i feel like there may be one - if only just ONE - person out there who needs to hear this right now. recovery is not just possible, it's plausible. you may be doing this on your own, but you're never alone. try to remember that. and good luck.

During the American Revolution, the United States fought against tyranny, oppression, and bondage. Like the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon, we had our fair share of disadvantages. Things did not look good and a plague of doubt and hopelessness swept the nation. This was called “The Crisis” as Americans started to realize, one by one, that there was little chance at winning this war. A few men stayed to fight but many men gave up and returned home – these men were called “sunshine patriots,” meaning they were loyal to their country only while it was winning or while the tides had been turned in its favor.

The term was coined by Thomas Paine in a written address during this widespread depression crisis, “THESE are the times that try men’s souls,” he wrote. Times of sadness and despair, times of misery and suffering.

In times of prosperity, it seems there is God all around us. He’s in our bounty, in the beauty, in our wealth. So, with him so prominent, feeling so blessed, it’s easy to believe. It is in times of challenge and hardship, of loss and bad-luck that our faith is tested, that *we* are tested. The entire point behind faith is that *you don’t know for sure, but you believe.* When times get rough, when it seems there is *no evidence* of God – how could he allow such suffering? – these are the times that God is asking you, “Do you believe in me, even if I don’t show you that I’m here?”

And faith is hard work. Faith in God, or faith in yourself – it doesn’t \*poof\* appear out of nowhere as if sprouting from the tip of your nose. Faith takes effort, it takes investment, it takes constantly reminding yourself of your cause and your reasons and your future. In times of wealth, fortune, and happiness, it is easy to love and to believe in God; when you are succeeding, it is easy to believe in yourself, just like the sunshine patriots were easily patriots when their country was in the lead. However, just like them, we often find that we may not have much faith in times of challenge.

“What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly,” wrote Paine. We tend to give things the value that we pay for them, and things that cost too little effort we tend to give less importance. The more profound our struggle, the more profound our victory. “Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.”

“By perseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and submission, the sad choice of a variety of evils – a ravaged country – a depopulated city – habitations without safety, and slavery without hope – our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses for Hessians, and a future race to provide for, whose fathers we shall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it unlamented.”

Man’s faith in his country is tested when it seems that his country might lose the war, but it is in these times that his country needs for him to believe in her the most, needs for him to believe in her motivations and morals and principles, to believe in her people and in the strength of independence and freedom, to believe in right and wrong, that Truth will defeat Lie and Good will defeat Evil and Light will defeat Darkness. Because remember: the few brave men that *did* stay and fight, those who *did* believe – just like the Athenians, they ended up winning.

What was it about them that made them stay, against all logic and such a bad prognosis? Their faith. And what did it take to keep their faith, even to the bloody, savage end? Courage.It takes *courage* to act on and to keep faith.

Courage is bravery, especially in the face of fear or pain, it’s the will and perseverance to do what you know is right; the horse that leads you proudly into battle – your own version of spears and shields wielded in defense of liberty, family, and your tomorrow.

For some of us, when we think of courage we think of saving the girl or sticking up to the bully. Sometimes, courage is being honest or admitting a mistake. Sometimes, it’s defending and protecting something that we love. We know courage when we see it, when we feel it, and sometimes even more importantly, we know when courage is lacking. Courage is not drug- or high-induced, it cannot be acted or faked and it cannot be tricked. Courage can’t be manufactured, it comes not from the outside but from our very own jelly-filled centers.

Courage can be fostered, however, it can be cultivated, it can grow inside of  us little by little as we use it in practice. When we believe in something, we create a courage inside of us to defend that belief. When we love something, we find within ourselves the courage to protect and care for it. When we want something, we muster the courage to do what it takes to get up and get it. Courage will always defeat a lack of courage. Courage will always defeat narcissism, cowardice, and apathy, for courage is selfless, it is brave, a passionate illumination of the dark and the empty. Even when we feel weak, if we are courageous we will be powerful.

Facing your own addiction means a lot of things. It means facing the fact that you have a problem, which means facing the fact that you’re out of your own control. It means facing all of the mistakes you’ve made including people you’ve hurt, things you’ve destroyed, and relationships that have been suffering. It means making a decision to put effort toward changes, some of which will be very hard to implement. It means having to apologize for some things, having to make up for some things, and having to re-earn the trust of those closest to us. It means saying goodbye to a life we knew well and once may even have loved. Ultimately, it means facing a future of uncertain anxieties and hard work – and doing this takes *courage*. It takes *courage* to face our pasts and our addictions and it takes *courage* to face our futures and our recoveries – and a recovering addict must *simultaneously face both*.

 

## “You will come to learn that what appears to be a sacrifice todaywill prove to be the greatest investment you’ll ever make.” – Gordon B. Hinkley

&#x200B;

Pain is your body’s way of directing your focus onto a problem so that the problem can be resolved as quickly, efficiently, and effectively as possible. Pain serves to protect us, as does fear, letting us know that something is wrong and alerting us to a possible threat. When you lay your hand on a hot stove burner, it takes but a split second for you to jerk your hand away – and that’s because pain is doing its job. If the pain hadn’t told you that you were cooking yourself, you’d have done a lot more damage than just blister the skin.

The same is true for emotional or mental pain. If you are hurting then something is wrong. Before you can get help, you have to recognize that you need help – and before you can recognize that you need help, you have to recognize that there’s a problem. Though it may seem logical, this isn’t always obvious. Sometimes it’s harder for us to see that there’s something wrong with the way we’re feeling, acting and behaving because that would mean admitting some mistakes, and it’s much easier for us to reason those away than it is to confront them. Allowing yourself to consider that you’ve got a problem is a major milestone in your addiction and recovery process.

Your next big milestone will be admitting that you need help, admitting that you need an outside perspective, support, advice, or even just a friend to talk to. Addiction has kept you trapped at the rancid bottom of an old well and you’ve been trying to climb the walls, clawing at them, fingernails broken and bloody – but it’s too dark to see down here, there’s nothing to hold on to, the walls are slippery smooth, the climb is too high, you know you’re fated here to rot – so if someone cast down a rope, would you not take it?

Some people refuse the rope, claiming they don’t need any help, they aren’t struggling, they can do this all on their own and they will be fine. Some people refuse the rope because they’re afraid it might make them appear weak and incapable. Some people refuse the rope because they know, deep down, they don’t deserve the generosity. But those who *do* take the rope are the ones who are back in the sunlight. Asking for help takes a lot of guts. Accepting help takes a lot of guts. But successful people do whatever they must in order to win, and if asking for help is what it’s going to take then you’d better be prepared to suck it up and do so. After you’ve taken that initial step and begun your healing process, then you’re already on your way, things have already started to improve, and some of the hardest parts about all of this are behind you.

I hear people sometimes say, ""I'm not afraid of anything."" And they think their (alleged) lack of fear is what makes them courageous. They think by having no worries or anxieties or apprehensions that they are the ones who are strong, who are independent and powerful. But if you fear nothing, how can you ever be brave? No, bravery does not come from a lack of fear, bravery comes in the face of fear. Those who are fearful - fearful of recovery, of hard work, of pain, of uncertainty - those who are afraid are those who've the opportunity to stand up to their fear, the opportunity to be truly brave, truly courageous, truly righteous.

Having to face up to your flaws and mistakes and accepting that it’s time for a change is hard – it takes strength, it takes *courage.* If you are fearful, if you are scared, if you are anxious - that's good. That just means you've been given the opportunity to stand up to those fetid voices in your head, to prove to yourself and to the world that your fear, your pain is not your *weakness*, it is your valiant battle *against* fear and pain, it's every forward step *despite* pain, *despite* fear, *despite* anxiety, it's the fight for your future no matter the darkness you're in - your weaknesses are testing you, and that - along with such a bright, sober future in mind - is making you *strong*.

## “Self-control is the chief element of self-respect,and self-respect is the chief element of courage.” -Thucydides

&#x200B;

Courage can come from a belief in yourself, a confidence in your own capabilities that allows for that belief. Courage is in knowing your own boundaries and limitations – and your ability in extending them. Courage is a *self-respect*, built by experience and opposition, by defiance and provocation, by the trials and lessons of addiction.

*Self-respect* is *earned.* And it is earned the same way that respect for other people or other things is earned – through experiences that prove *honesty*, exemplify *capabilities*, and build *trust*. A big part of recovery is rebuilding relationships, and that includes our relationships with ourselves. Right now, you don’t trust yourself to do the things you say you will do, though you may fully *intend* to follow through. You have seen yourself break too many promises to other people, you have heard yourself lie too many times to other people, you have witnessed your own greed and gluttony and you haven’t seen much self-control lately. You know you are flighty, you know you are unreliable, you know you are victim to your emotions and that makes you fickle and erratic. No, if anyone is to distrust you and your sincerity right now, it’s yourself.

Just like you have to prove yourself to your friends and family, you will have to prove yourself to you, too. As you navigate your recovery, you will have opportunities to show yourself that you mean what you say, you are trustworthy, what you’re capable of, that you’re resolute and reliable, that there’s no one you can count on more, that you will never have to depend on anyone or anything else again. After a while, and with enough effort, trust can be re-built, and you will start to believe in your own words again. And after a while, that trust becomes solid, and with that solidified trust comes a power, a strength, a supportive inner coordination and a confidence. This confidence can bleed outward, onto every other aspect of our lives, helping to motivate and inspire us to do what we feel we need to do, to be courageous and fight for the things that we know are right – *like our recovery.*

I would love to have some advice, and insight.",6,m1u8w5,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1u8w5/hi_im_a_27_m_and_im_an_heroin_addict_i_would_love/,15,"Hi guys first of all thanks everyone for willing to help me. I'll keep it short. I've been an addict for almost 4 years now, and decided last year to get help.

Since my addiction I got RLS(Restless legs syndrome), and I only have that when I haven't been using for 2 days. Also the after affects are so difficult to deal with. The past 2 years I've been snorting 1gr a day, and that's 10gr a week. Now the couple few month's I've been using only 1gr max a week. And I achieved this all by myself, and not without any help. Mentally I'm strong and I want to quit, but the after effects, the RLS, etc is so heavy..  wish I could inject something and bam I'm not an addict anymore.

The institution where I go weekly wants me to get on subuxone, their reasoning was that its easier to get off from it, and it doesn't affect my COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Chronische Obstructieve Long disease) it has 5 stages that goes from 0 till 5. 

I've taken methadone before, and it really helped me while I used it, and felt really comfortable with it. It's really expensive tho, but having a stuffed nose for 4 years also really sucks.  I've never inject heroin and never will. I once smoked it, but the next day I needed to use my asthma cause I couldn't breath. I rather have methadone But the institution I've joined said that methadone can also be very addictive, and that's why they wanted me on subuxone. 

So my question is does subuxone helps me sleep, and negate the RLS, and is it really better than methadone?

Thanks in advance people, and may we all be sober even during these harsh times! 

If you've any questions just ask them!",1615399484

I think I’m becoming addicted to adderall and I want to quit but I don’t know where to start,3,m1tg55,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1tg55/i_think_im_becoming_addicted_to_adderall_and_i/,2,"I apologize in advance for how long this post is, and if it’s all over the place my brain has felt like it’s just not working the last couple days. But I (23f) was diagnosed with add in December 2020 and was prescribed 5mg adderall. I had taken it in high school once or twice to study and I took 50mg at that time so I thought starting on 5mg was dumb. From the first dose I took I immediately had this voice in my head telling me to just take one more pill every few hours. I took my whole months prescription within a week and a half. I had a few binges where I stayed up for 48 hours in that time so after i finished the bottle I was kinda burnt out and able to just wait until my next prescription was ready. 

I definitely was thinking about it constantly but I didn’t really have any withdrawal symptoms so I thought I could just keep this up until I got prescribed a higher dose. I convinced myself it was just too low a dose and once I was taking like 30mg a day I’d be able to control it.

So I eventually got prescribed 10mg xr in January and I did the same thing with my prescription again. Except this time I had a friend who was selling adderall so I thought I’d just buy some on the side until I got my prescription bumped up. The problem with that was I was buying 20mg ir and I spent over $300 on about a weeks worth. I was still taking more than one a day, up to 3, and I stayed up binging for 48 hours again a few times. I’m an artist and I liked that I could start a painting and just keep popping them until I finished the painting in 48 hours which would usually take me weeks.

I don’t really remember how it went in February, I’m sure it was the same, abusing my prescription and waiting. Until I bought $500 worth of 30mg ir a few weeks ago. I didn’t want 30mg, I was looking for 20mg again but I could only find 30 so I bought them anyway. Ever since then, I can feel myself spiraling downhill quick and it scares the hell out of me.

I’ve been taking at least 90mg per day for the last week up until yesterday.. I noticed that after another 48 hour binge 2-3 days ago when I took about 7 30mg pills in 48 hours I started hallucinating and just feeling off. When I squatted down (this finally stopped today) I would get super light headed and I’d feel my heart beat in my ears, and I’ve basically stopped eating. I went from being a really bad binge eater weighing 210lbs down to 190lbs just in the last month or two. I was excited about this because I have body dysmorphia and a binge eating problem that I’ve had no control over for years so this is one thing that makes me not want to quit. Also my mom is very happy with how I’ve been acting, before adderall I had no motivation or energy, no focus, no social skills and I was eating soooo much. So I’ve lightly brought up not liking adderall and wanting to quit to her and my fear of addiction and she just says to stop thinking like that it’s working so well and if I get addicted we’ll cross that bridge when we get there. She also asks me every day if I’m taking my adderall and if I don’t take it she gets upset with me. I’m scared to tell her I have a problem with it. It’s so scary, it’s like when I take it I have this voice I can’t shut up or ignore that just tells me to take more and more.

During my last binge I became obsessed with reading about self development and self help and I kind of had an epiphany that I need to stop. I’m just so scared to tell my parents that I have a problem and I also am afraid to tell my psychiatrist, I don’t want to be labeled an addict and end up having trouble getting other medications in the future or just upset her and have her not trust me because I’ve been lying to her for the last 4 ish months. But I know if I don’t stop now this is going to take over my life. 

I’m starting to have withdrawal symptoms now. I’ve been waking up with headaches and extreme fatigue and I can’t get out of bed until I take a pill. I took only 30mg yesterday and felt weird. Today I woke up feeling so sick I couldn’t wake up, I slept in super late and when I got up I took 30mg and thought I was just getting sick but within 30 mins I was feeling decent. Then after the first hour or so I started feeling shitty again, and I was so irritable today I literally couldn’t smile or laugh I was just grumpy and annoyed all day. I haven’t had that voice telling me to take more today or yesterday but I think it’s just because of all the positive stuff I read and I’ve been motivated to better my life and also all the negative things that have happened to my body in the last couple weeks. 

My skin started breaking out on my legs, I think it was like inflamed hair follicles and I already have a compulsive skin picking and hair plucking problem but the adderall intensifies it so I spent several hours picking at my skin and plucking hairs and I ended up having little bumps allllll over my body, now they’re basically scars and they’re so ugly I feel so ashamed. I also got a staph infection on my stomach a few weeks ago and I’ve been ignoring it till today, I woke up in the worst pain and feeling extremely sick and weak. Idk if it’s directly related to the adderall but I know the compulsive picking didn’t help me not get staph. But I’ve been unable to tell if I am experiencing withdrawal, seratonin syndrome (I also take 10mg lexapro and 500mg divalproex for bipolar disorder daily and I just found out about seratonin syndrome so I’m very scared), or a staph infection spreading. But I got on antibiotics today so hopefully I’ll be able to eliminate one of them. But I don’t think I’ll be able to just quit cold turkey or to even go down to just 10mg again yet. So I probably need to get help but I’m just so scared of disappointing everyone and getting in trouble. I know I’m a 23 year old grown woman but I just moved back in with my parents for the first time since I was 17 and i feel like I’ve betrayed their trust. If anyone has any advice for telling my loved ones and getting help or experience quitting adderall I would really appreciate anything. Or even just someone encouraging me to quit would be nice. I don’t think I can handle this type of medication without abusing it and at this point my add was less damaging than this medication has been.",1615396092

I don’t run with other users, I work hard and come home to my family every night. I use in between all this though. Really at this point I use just to keep going I think, and well I’m an addict is another reason. I have used drugs since I was 14 but mostly drinking and eating acid and shrooms (the good bad drugs). Had a romance with crack for a bit but now Im stuck in the shit with meth. In patient treatment is not an option right now and outpatient is hit and miss for me.

years. I know that if I don’t fix this it will eventually catch up to me. I am terrified at the possibility of hurting my family by letting them down if I end up in jail or bankrupt us or any of the other severe consequences of this addiction. My wife knows about it but kind of stays out of it. When it comes to the surface,usually after something drastic happens, I tell her I will quit and then of course that never works out. By then though enough time has passed that if I tell her Im trying to find help or need to find help, she gets pissed because I have been doing it since the last time I said I would quit. She doesn’t know that I use daily. I have stayed up until at least 2am every night for the past 5-7yrs and go to work at 8am every day, That can’t be healthy.

What’s with the use?,2,m1qhur,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1qhur/whats_with_the_use/,2,"I hate being an addict, it has ruined every facet of my life, my decision making is very poor, my judgment skewed by the intrinsic nature of the desire to get high and to just float by, I am a highly functioning addict. I’ve tried to get sober many times with to no avail, I’ve tried religion, exercise, therapy, meetings and whatever else. But the truth is that I just don’t care, or maybe I care way to much. I’m not to sure, I have a big heart with a small mind. That’s how I feel.....small compared to everyone else and how the think and act, I think and believe I am not smart, but then again I know I am. But I just can’t understand what it is to be ok with not being ok. It’s hard to feel comfortable, I’m surprised I am not dead, I really wanted to die this week....I was drowning in my own putrid thoughts, thinking selfishly about it. I don’t want my kids to turn out like me, addiction runs in my family and I desperately want it to die with me, I will do everything I can to help my children if they end up such. I will hold them and tell them I love them and be there for them and build them up and tell them it’s okay to hurt, it’s ok that you have used and whatever, being an addict means unfortunately in this day and age even though it’s becoming widely accepted, we’re still in a different caste and I feel second rate. I just would love to be happy with who I am and not critical of myself and my thoughts. I use to because I’m wound up to tight and I worry all the time and the drugs always make me not worry and calm me down, especially the opiates, heroin, and benzo’s and whatever......it’s like I need to be and feel sedated all the time just to function through time. I wanna be the best version of myself that I can be...without drugs. I’m so tired and very exhausted from all the years of use.....I don’t want to be an addict but I am, and although I do accept it and kind of wear it as a badge I despise myself for it, but I have learned so much from it. I wish I could just really understand why I use and why I always keep going back out, I am very lucky, I have had success in my life even as an addict and a third time felon with a ovi, I still find a way to preserver and idk, I have a good job, good kids, a girlfriend....I’m currently going through a divorce but it’s weird cuz my wife and I still love each other very much but the relationship is toxic and broken.....I’m not sure how to go about that.

For example like when I take drugs with my friends which isn’t very often (like coke or mdma) I get so possessive over it and have to take it the furthest so to speak like there is no scenario where I’m not the last one awake shouting at everyone to carry on the party, I also used to be quite bad with gambling but I can give or take it but once I started it would take a substantial loss for me to stop then one day I lost too much and never done it again for years. I have been gambling casually recently but then today something just switched in me and I lost a fairly large amount of money as I just kept going and going... so what I’m trying to say is that even though these things I don’t do very frequently I find that there’s a fine line and once I’m over it I’m taking it further and further.. would this still be considered addiction?

Hello Reddit I need advice on how to proceed with me over stepping boundaries in regards to concerns with my sisters drug abuse. [Kinda long a bit but please help and read fully],1,m1dlyy,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1dlyy/hello_reddit_i_need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with/,14,"Please try to remain none subjective when responding and realize that what was done is done and the rating me for my decisions will not provide advice I am looking for. 

A few months ago I overstepped my sister's boundaries and called her psychiatrist with concerns regarding the prescribing of benzodiazepines to her.

First I would like to state that I was aware I was overstepping boundaries when I made the decision to call her psychiatrist but I Weighed the negatives versus the positives of overstepping boundaries and I came to the conclusion that The benefits outweighed the negatives and that I would be okay with accepting the consequences of my actions.


The reason I called my sister psychiatrist was because she admitted to me that she was going to suggest her doctor prescribe her a benzodiazepine to treat her anxiety. 

Benzodiazepines have high potential for abuse and addiction. 

I was concerned with her receiving a prescription because my sister has exhibited drug abuse and addiction throughout most of her life. 

Since I have lived with her she has shown that she will do anything to get high especially when she does not have any pot. 

She has stolen my mother's benzodiazepines in the past as well as she admitted to me that she attempted to steal mine but was unsuccessful. 

She wants abused a over-the-counter sleep aid in an attempt to get high. 

She already had a problem with abusing her ADHD medication.

She is also irresponsible regarding medication in that a few weeks ago she had left out a medication on her bed and to which one of her children had gotten access to and did something with as we found the bottle empty concerned that she may have ingested the substance we called poison control who assured us that even if the child did consume the contents that it was not life-threatening.

So after that call I made my sister take all of her medication and put it in the cabinet in the bathroom so it was out of reach of the children. 

then my sister has obtained new medication and once again I had noticed that she left it on the bed in her room instead of putting it in the cabinet. 
Once again and shows irresponsibility. 

My parents are also enabling her self-destructive behavior regarding medication and drug abuse in that they feel that it is not a problem that she smokes pot because they state that it is beneficial Because it allows her to eat and relieves anxiety. 

furthermore speaking with my mother expressing my concerns to my mother has also been pushing for her to receive benzodiazepines to manage her anxiety despite the obvious addictive behavior and addictive personality. 

However in a note of relief my mother stated that she would be locking up her medication and distributed accordingly.
But to add to that my mother will be moving out in a few months as well as my sister so who will manage her administration of her medication to ensure her safety?

Also since I have lived here my sister has been very underweight and malnourished to the point that I had bought her protein shakes with vitamins and proteins to help her ensure that her body is getting the nourishment it needs. Thus pot is proving to be ineffective in treating her eating issues. 

 My sister also claims that pot helps with her anxiety since I lived here She has expressed anxiety even when she smokes. Thus I feel pond is ineffective in treating her anxiety. 

I called my sister's psychiatrist and left an anonymous message explaining all of these things and that I felt prescribing a benzodiazepine was unwise because of everything I explained and also according to the DSM-5 and the regulations set by the FDA benzodiazepines are only to be prescribed in those diagnosed with anxiety or panic disorder. 

Well I feel that my sister does have anxiety I do not believe that an anxiety disorder is accurate because the DSM-5 states that one of the qualifiers for an anxiety disorder is that the patient must suffer from chronic anxiety 
**not caused by outside influences** since I lived here I have noticed that all of my sisters anxiety is caused by outside influences and her actions. Which would not qualify for her for an anxiety disorder diagnosis.

Therefore prescribing benzodiazepines would not be following the recommended guidelines. 

furthermore I believe that her psychiatrist had not tried all other alternatives to treating her anxiety disorders and is rather jumping to something with potential for abuse which is also against the FDA's guidelines and prescribing benzodiazepines. 

Despite me warning her psychiatrist All these things he proceeded to prescribe her her a benzodiazepine anyway. 

The reason I did all of this is because I fear for my sister's safety as well as her children and that addiction is very highly likely to occur with her. I decided that my intervention was necessary despite the consequences I would face. 

My sister is psychiatrist has expressed that he received my phone call and have made her aware of it this is going to cause major issues with me and my parents. 

I am contemplating reporting my sister's psychiatrist to the board of health or whatever organization is appropriate.

I fear the argument that will ensue when this topic is inevitably discussed with my parents. 

I feel that even if I bring up everything I wrote here that my parents will be dismissive of the facts and fight me at every turn. I believe that they will claim to the fact that I overstep boundaries without acknowledging the reason why as well as the facts that I will point out. 

I spoke to my therapist about this and she suggests that I write all of this down so that's when we have to talk I can have the information written down to express easily and that is also part of the reason of this post. So I would like to ask all of you to please give me any additional advice that you may have. 

Lastly I know that many of you will be very against my decision to overstep boundaries by calling my sisters psychiatrist but I would like you retain the reasons why I made the decision I did, as well as what was done was done and that I am looking for information on how to proceed. 
I asked that in your responses you tried to remain non-subjective and non-judgmental.",1615345510

Any advice on how to control an addictive personality??,1,m1crke,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m1crke/any_advice_on_how_to_control_an_addictive/,2,"I’m 22, and over the past few years I have caught myself slipping into various addictions. (I hope it’s not degrading/insulting to those of you who’ve suffered from long term issues that I’m using the term ‘addiction’ - but I think that’s what it is?)

I don’t really have the money for therapy or such like at the moment, so does anyone have any advice or help that they’ve received, to help with those times when you start to get caught up in an addiction?

I say addictive personality because over the years I’ve fallen into various vices, but only for relatively short periods of time. When I had my first full time job at 18, the majority of my earnings went into gambling for months, since then I’ve avoided it until quite recently when I’ve felt the grip of it again. Another situation was a couple of years back, which started when I was in a rough patch of a relationship, but I ended up abusing ketamine almost daily - for months. This past month I got my hands on some speed - telling myself it would help my productivity - but again it’s got to the point where I’m using it every day, and I can’t seem to drag myself out of the hole. 

I’m not sure if this is even a cry out for advice, or perhaps just me trying to open up to anyone, but I do think any advice would be accepted graciously.

(Funnily enough I’ve never really had a problem with abusing alcohol, I think partly because my dad was an alcoholic so a part of my subconscious is sensible enough to stay away, and partly because my depression and anxiety gets massively worsened when I’m hungover)

Thanks in advance.",1615343154

10 Years Clean,89,m0jnyq,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m0jnyq/10_years_clean/,18,"10 years ago this month I entered rehab for a debilitating Adderall and Ambien addiction. I remember sitting in my mothers car as we drove and asked...""How did I get here? How did I go from the dude that never drank at parties and hadn't done a hard drug since my early 20s to the guy that lost everything and is headed to rehab?"" I was prescribed both drugs, used them as they were supposed to be used...then, I remember the exact day I doubled my dose of Adderall...it was the end of life as I knew it. 

Over the next 3 years I would lose my job, fail at my own company, lose my home, move into my sisters garage, then to a weekly hotel, then to my car...then back to the hotel. I alienated everyone in my life...would go weeks without talking. Near the end, I was closed up in a closet for 2 days, without eating or using the bathroom, only drinking a little bit of water and doing Adderall. I was out of Ambien and couldn't sleep. I was dying and I knew it...and accepted it.

My sister called me and asked how I was...it was the first time I didn't lie about my situation...I told her I needed help. Mom showed up the next morning to take me to Rehab. Rock Bottom was a terrible place to be. Over the next two years I would relapse for a week here and a week there...then, I had a massive heart attack. The doctor told me I was no longer an Adderall addict...I was like, Really? He was like, Yep. See, if you do Adderall now it will kill you...so, no longer an addict. Point made.

I was surrounded by great and forgiving friends. I dug into my faith and went through the 12 steps a couple of time with my mentor Dick Brookfield. I surrounded myself with people who understood what I was going through and helped nurse me into the best version of myself. Life is so much better now than it was at anytime before my addiction. 

It's hard, looking back at the version of me that lived for my addiction when my biggest fear was not being able to find more Adderall. Who was that guy? That dude was broken...but not beyond repair. I have God to thank for that. My faith met me where I was and helped to remove the blanket of shame that had kept me broken. My church surrounded me with people that had been where I was and knew how to get me back on track. This has been by far the best decade of my life...and it's only getting better every day.

I have always been honest here on FB about my struggle. Believe me, it's not easy. But, I made a vow during recovery to use my experience to help others. If you are an addict, reach out to a friend, family member, Pastor, 12 step program, something. There is a better life out there...believe me...the road back is not easy...but it's worth every baby step after baby step. When all else is gone, God still loves you. That's a powerful thing when you fully comprehend it.",1615250246

Dear friend passed away and I have no idea how to deal..,2,m0lmdr,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/m0lmdr/dear_friend_passed_away_and_i_have_no_idea_how_to/,3,"Let me start off by saying I'm 60 days clean and struggling with near constant urges. I have a great community of sober friends and my friend who passed away, well call him Mole, was one of those friends until he hooked up with a woman and went off the deep end.

Nothing unusual as this is the nature of addiction. I was partying with Mole in December and I've always been totally infatuated with him. Sweetest fucking guy I know. We hung out a lot over the summer, sober together as well. Beautiful summer I will cherish forever.

Cut to me losing my shit drinking every day unable to function. Go to rehab. Find out Mole is in a coma. Lots of hope he would come out of it. Days pass with no progress and I come home clean, to find out a week later Mole had passed away..

I still haven't processed his death and writing it out is helping.. but I still find myself waiting for him to show up randomly. I can't believe he's gone. I have never lost a close friend before and the fact that I was enamored by him makes it that much harder..

Please share any experience you have.. the whole not processing death, which has always been a recurring issue for me, is making me feel the reality will hit me out of nowhere and I don't wanna lose my mind",1615255137

Topic: Willpower 
Recovery has taught us we are powerless over gambling and that willpower alone is not enough to maintain long term abstinence. This may result in the mistaken belief that willpower has little or no value.  

Please share your thoughts and/or experiences on the importance of  willpower in recovery. 

Has your willpower become stronger in recovery? 
How much do you rely on willpower to avoid the first bet? 
Has willpower alone been enough to keep you proactive in recovery and guard against complacency?

Lessons learned from my current relapse,5,lzu2rg,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lzu2rg/lessons_learned_from_my_current_relapse/,4,"**TLDR** at the end, I'm a bit chatty today.

I had been clean for more or less one year.

I have now relapsed into my drug of choice (3-MMC).

I'm disappointed of myself but I'm not beating myself up. Nothing bad has happened yet, the damage is controlled, I'll get back up on my feet in no time.

I thought I'd share a few things I have discovered during this relapse.

First thing is that I was idealizing my drug of choice. Taking it again was very disappointing at first. I was expecting effects I didn't get. I even suspected I did not get the right product (but I did).

Second thing is that I'm now able to realize that I am not the best version of myself when I'm on drugs. Before, being high just felt absolutely right, as if I was reaching the real truth about myself and the world. Now, while I still enjoy the drugs very much, I have this feeling that there's something off, that the high is not the best thing that can be achieved in life, that it's a bit wrong.

Third thing, it took days of heavy use to start enjoying the drug like before again.

I did not believe drugs rewire the brain as much as they do.

I thought I just liked drugs. But it seems that liking drugs actually requires some level of effort / involvement. It's not innate. The way I see it now, drugs rewire the brain to make you enjoy them and this rewiring makes you enjoy the normal things less.

I've always known the theory but for the first time I'm seeing it happening to me. And it gives me hope. If my brain can be screwed this way it can also be unscrewed.

And the fact it took a few days for me to start feeling the effects of the drugs that I was remembering proved to me that abstinence had helped me reverse the damages of addiction quite a bit.

Lastly, of all the things I learned in various rehabs, the only one that is helping me right now is to reinvest in my relationships with my friends and family. Trying to be there for them keeps me alive. I make plans with friends and follow through, even when I think I'd have more fun just doing tons of lines alone in the dark. Keeps me from losing touch with the world, gives me the motivation to be a part of it.

Also, something that strangely nobody had ever suggested to me: I bought a time lock safe. I'm not ready to get rid of the stash right now, but with the safe I can commit to being sober for e.g. 24 hours which is already a win.

**TLDR**

- using again is not as fun as I was expecting it to be
- the way I feel and what I think when on drugs now in comparison to my previous period of use shows me I have made a lot of progress
- there's a huge physical component to addiction and time helps heal
- love is the answer

Best of luck to all who are struggling.",1615163450

Hello,

Hopefully this is not a stupid question; because I really am trying to understand myself and live a good life.

I really struggle with alcohol, rage (which I believe is because I'm OCD with relationships if that makes sense). It completely changes me. I am on Prozac and propranolol (For IED).

I know my Dad said addiction runs in our family, but he also mentioned that before we left South Africa to move to the US (I was 2 or 3), my parents and I were in a really bad car accident. I hit my head extremely hard and my father said my head was VERY swollen (that I looked like an alien).

I guess what I am asking is... could that have affected me and be a reason I am struggling with addiction and a short temper today?

I appreciate you all as this wasn't easy for me to reach out.",1615181065

I am struggling. Self destruction.,5,lzjx47,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lzjx47/i_am_struggling_self_destruction/,5,"I have been sober for 16 months. I have BPD. I have made a lot of progress but I tend to backslide when things get rough. Granted, it really is pretty damn rough right now. I have developed many tools using dialectical behavioral therapy tactics, but it still gets really bad.

 It's like I am fighting off a volcano.  My emotions uncontrollably pour out of me. Sometimes my fear, sometimes my sadness, sometimes my anger. When my anger comes out it's like I completely lose control. 

I feel like I am watching myself act out; like I am watching and saying what the fuck are you doing. Like I'm standing behind all my emotions and trying to push through them. I hate it. 

This past year I have destroyed everything I built and had built a lot. Self sabotage.  I'm broken.  Heart broken and I am the culprit.

 I am struggling with everything that's going on in my life. Sometimes it hurts so bad I break down, sobbing pathetically. Then I feel scared and alone. Then I feel angry, angry at the world, angry at myself, angry at everything; and then that makes me sad and the cycle continues. I lost the only person I had by my side because I am an emotional train wreck. 

The person I love doesn't want me anymore and it's my fault. It hurts. I'm lost. I am an asshole.

I hate that I am so fucking emotional. My emotions consume me and sometimes it feels like a hurricane in my head and all through my body. It's overwhelming. 

I'll be okay. I am resilient. I'll be okay. I have tools and I will use them. I always get back up. Always.

Been chasing a high for 5 years,5,lzindw,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lzindw/been_chasing_a_high_for_5_years/,19,"I’m not sure if this is the appropriate place to post this but here I go. I’m not an addict. I’ve never been addicted to anything. I drink occasionally and smoked a little weed in college but nothing more than that. 

A little backstory. I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. My anxiety is very physical. I get all nearly all of the stereotypical physical symptoms of anxiety. 

My anxiety reached its peak in college. One day after classes, I returned to my apartment and my anxiety hit me like a Mack truck. It was the worst it’s ever been. Heart palpitations, chest pains, shortness of breath that lasted hours. It seemed like it wouldn’t go away so I finally decided to give in and go to the ER. 

This is the part where the possibility of addiction comes into play. After hours of sitting in the ER I was finally seen by a doctor. They took my blood pressure, did an EKG and took blood. Everything thing looked good and the doc said my heart was in tip top shape. He said what I was experiencing symptoms because of anxiety and told me he was going to give me something to calm me down. I was like “K. Cool”.  

He comes back in the room with vial of clear liquid in a needle. Turns out what he gave me was Valium. About two minutes later it started to kick in. I still remember it vividly. It is—still to this day—the best I have ever felt. I literally cried when it wore off. 

Ever since then I’ve been trying to get my hands on more. This feeling completely scares me. I was given Valium once in an ER five years ago and I’m still fending for it to this day. Whenever I’m depressed or my anxiety gets really bad, my first thought is “if I could just have Valium again I would be okay”.  

The only reason I haven’t actually gotten my hands on more is because I’m not street wise so I wouldn’t know where to find a legit dealer and I’m not a good liar so I wouldn’t be able to trick a therapist into prescribing me some. But if someone brought some to a party I happened to go to I would 100% take it. 

Has anyone ever heard of someone’s addiction starting from getting Valium in the ER?",1615118466

So I’ve been sober from marijuana for almost 6 months now (yay!) and I have another addiction I’d like to chip away at.

Any strategies for this? Old snapping rubber band on the wrist whenever I think about it? Similar to kicking other habits? 

I literally spent 9 hours watching tv today. I could have read a book that I’ve been meaning to get through. Help.",1615118073
Recovery Dharma (12-step alternative),16,lz7v4q,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lz7v4q/recovery_dharma_12step_alternative/,11,"Good morning everyone,

I am posting in hopes that this reaches the people who are meant to see it. Or, that this information will be passed on to those in need who may connect with the concept. 

I am a recovering opiate addict. I've been clean 258 days, or 8 months and 13 days. I used for about 7 years (most of my adult life, I am 33F) and getting and ultimately *staying* off my substances of choice (prescription pills, and I abused Suboxone) has been more challenging than I ever could have imagined. 

But I'm not here to talk about me. I'm here to tell you about Recovery Dharma (RD), which has been the single most significant contributing factor in maintaining my sobriety. 

RD is a peer-led program for recovering addicts of all kinds (alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling - *any addiction*) that is based on Buddhist practices and principles, meditation, Sangha (community), and readings, which are implemented to heal the suffering of addiction. 

In their words: 

""We believe that the traditional Buddhist teachings, often referred to as the Dharma, offer a powerful approach to healing from addiction and living a life of true freedom. Our program is based on the idea that every one of us is our own guide in recovery from addiction, with the help and understanding of our wise friends and sangha (community). We believe that’s what the Dharma teaches us. So it’s with great joy and excitement that we come together to build this recovery community and support structure, informed by the spirit of democracy.""

You can find meetings (Zoom meetings go on every day, multiple times a day), and all the information you need at:

www.recoverydharma.org

All are welcome at *any meeting* (unless otherwise specified in meeting details, example: women only, LGBTQ, etc). Come as you are, we will be happy you're there joining us. 

They also have free copies of their book under the resources tab, and a free audiobook version (my personal favorite). 

RD does not ask that you believe in anything but the power of yourself and the support of community to heal addiction. Participate at your own comfort level. Listen. Observe. Acclimate. Introduce yourself, or don't. We were all new once and there is no pressure whatsoever. 

I have been an active participant in the RD program.for only a few months and it has already altered my perspective and changed my life for the better. I never meditated or gave Buddhism a second thought before RD, so this is all very new to me. My point is, you don't have to be devoted to anything to begin meetings. All are welcome, this is your journey to unfold. 

My inbox is always open should anyone have a question or need further guidance, I will do my best to help! 

Edit: Just to be clear, I am not a spokesperson for RD and have not been asked to promote this program. I am doing it simply because getting the information out there could give someone the chance to begin their journey to sobriety, that is all ❤️

I'm a last year lawstudent and I have had a couple of years of sniffing ritalin. In fact I still do.  I can see clearly that I'm not able to not sniff it when I'm studying, but the weird thing is that my body or mind isn't craving it whenever I'm not studying. It's somehow like a periodical addiction.

The problem is that I've noticed that I can't focus decently and long enough whenever I sniff it, but simply cannot withhold myself from doing it while studying. I know that I can study better and longer when I would just swallow it. I just want to find a way to force myself to just take it in normally.

I've been taking ritalin/medikinet for 3 years and my dosage varies between 40-70gr/studyday (Last two year mainly sniffing).

I'm posting this here in the hope that someone can relate or has any ideas/solutions.

I told him I wasn’t mad when I found him and very calmly told him I was relieved he was okay and told him to please not ever scare me like that again because I love and care about him. I’m trying to be supportive but level-headed and we do not want to be enabling.

My father was an addict, but I do not struggle with addiction and could use some advice on how to make my bro in law feel more loved and supported without smothering, babying, or being patronizing to him.

Lest we forget,34,lybhae,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lybhae/lest_we_forget/,4,"I once knew a wonderful man

He denied me when I asked to take his hand.

After years of blissful, faithful, love

A connection so strong it could never budge

The light in his eyes began to fade.

It was then I regrettably walked away.

Although I moved forward, I never moved on.

The faith that he gave me was just too strong.

I chased and chased the connection we had found

Growing tired and weary of being let down.

No two people are the same, and although he had changed,

No love could compare to the one we had made.

Too scared to turn back I kept my head high.

I found a terrific cliché of a guy.

Each day he moves mountains and changes for me.

He propels our life with stunning velocity.

It’s still hard for me.

I’ve grown stagnant and cold.

It’s love that I’ve found

But not the love that I know.

It’s been rough and demanding and so quick to flee,

Then promptly returning, leaving me a bit wary.

The child we had made, so perfect and pure,

Kept us fighting for every romantic cure.

Yet each time I would find myself nearly alone

My heart would return to the love it had known.

The wonderful man with such piercing blue eyes

Who’s compassion and warmth sent my heart soaring high.

The peace that he gave me, carries me still

Although I can’t feel it now, and perhaps never will.

At least not in this world as I continue the fight

To love again, to be stronger, to do what is right.

My heart splits open at night, when I drive, when I wake

It bleeds for his family, grieves for his face.

His time came too soon, without much closure

Just as the universe had finally brought us closer.

It’s hard to believe that those things aren’t related.

It consumes me with pain, with guilt I’m inundated.

He would want me to move on. I’m sure he thought that I had.

It’s just hard to get past this when I’m always so sad.

I want to appreciate all that I have.

I’m trying to love fully. I’m trying to laugh.

I’ll see him again. I just don’t want to wait.

It’s hard to believe there is an end to this pain.

It’s selfish and cruel to feel how I do.

Nothing tragic will come, I just have to make do.

I’m lucky and loved; I just need to be cool.

&#x200B;

  I recently lost a friend to heroin. We dated for years until suddenly I realized he was different and nothing in our life made sense. He had gotten addicted to pain pills and was too ashamed to tell me. I was working a lot and under so much stress. I regret every day that I didn't see the signs. I left him hoping his parents would understand what was going on and help him. I found out 8 months later that he had finally opened up about what was wrong and asked for help. I was mind blown. I remember calling him out of the blue so angry that he had never told me. I told him I never would have left him if he would have just said it was drugs. He sounded apologetic and embarrassed as I confronted him. I regret now being so bold with him. We didn't speak as much after that but I stayed close to his family through mutual friends. At his request, no one ever told me anything else about his struggle. He got clean for a while, but relapsed and it took his life late last year. I'm sharing my pain here because I was never able to be the friend he needed when he would never tell me anything. I've cried for months finally understanding what happened to him after years of wondering. I wanted more than anything for him to just be better and come back to me. Apparently he moved forward and never quite moved on as well. Things could have been so different for us if he would have just ignored the shame and guilt long enough to let me in. I'm hoping anyone here faced with addiction can read this and understand how much they are loved and avoid hiding from the people who can help. I'm lucky to have found a good man and started a healthy family, but it's hard to even appreciate the things I have with what I know now. I feel like I abandoned the love of my life when he needed me most, and he even says so in his journals, which his mother reads in tears when she wants to feel closer to him. Please trust that people love you and don't ever hide from the people who want to see you succeed. The pain I feel is far worse than any pain or disappointment he was trying to protect me from at the time. I wish I could have been there for him, and instead I have to wait until death even hope to ever see him again. I hope he is free now. I miss him.",1614978584

I’ve been to two rehabs (one for 30 one for 90), and while I did gain a lot of information from the daily routine, it was the people I learned it with that got me through and helped me stay clean afterwards. At a larger facility (about 50 clients), I was a 25 year old white kid from California, and my roommate was a 48 year old black cop from Tennessee. Our habits were different- I did heroin, he drank too much, but we became great friends. We’d stay up and talk about life, I’d tell him how I hid my drugs while using and he’d tell me that was all wrong and where the cops are trained to look etc, and I’d tell him about how intricate buying drugs from the dark web is and we’d laugh about it. We’ve stayed friends ever since, an unlikely duo. He’s the example I chose, but I also met plenty of other very sweet, good hearted men and women of all ages, backgrounds and persuasions who simply wanted to better themselves and be happy. My time spent talking to and seeing some of them after finishing the program kept me going. if somebody relapsed we supported them, but we all shared equal support and understanding. I’m going on two years clean. Some of my comrades have spiraled back down, others have a bunch of clean time.

I am a Gaming Addict and it’s destroying me.,51,ly2cn8,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ly2cn8/i_am_a_gaming_addict_and_its_destroying_me/,45,"Gaming has always been a massive part of my life and something that I’ve always had issues breaking away from. Most of my childhood I remember playing games with my family and friends. Before I had reached ten I was gaming for hours on end, my mother would always tell me off and try to hide my gaming consoles but me and my brother would find it when she would be away and I’d continue gaming. I could game all throughout the night and up until morning. My mother used to work late nights so no one would stop me. Then one day my eyes began blacking out, and I was worried about my sight and told my mum. She said it was because of my excessive gaming which I believe was true so I stopped playing games for a long time and began wearing glasses. Once the opticians had given me the OK I began playing games again however not as intensely. I was around 9 at the time. 

My mum had made sure that I didn’t overdo it with games again and I didn’t want to take any chances when she was away so I listened and gave my eyes the time to rest and stayed away from the TV, slowly getting back into gaming but in a controlled manner. Eventually I stopped wearing glasses. 

When I turned 16/17 I began gaming excessively. My mum never gave me the chance to game a bit more since I was a little older and getting decent grades at school. Life was hard around this time and my grades weren’t great and gaming was more of a priority over my studies and I could not find the discipline within myself to stop. So what I did was I deleted the application from my console (re-downloading it takes ages), threw the game disc behind my wardrobe so I couldn’t reach it and told myself I would finish college before I play again. I managed to get through, got grades I was happy with and gamed for majority of the summer. 

Then comes university/present. Again life became really hard and I made really bad life choices. One thing I found was that whenever I felt depressed or stressed out I would turn to gaming. Once I turn to gaming I couldn’t stop myself until my body feels like it’s about to shut down. Sometimes I would play games until the sun comes out. I wouldn’t pick up calls, I’d tell people I’d get back to them later. I was isolating myself and just playing games excessively on my phone and console. Now I feel lost. I have tonnes of university work to do as it’s my last year, I’m so close to the end yet the past couple days I’ve only been gaming, going back to it. My social life has deteriorated, I’ve developed depression and I have no motivation or drive to do anything. 

I ordered an old gaming console recently to try and relive my childhood games that I couldn’t finish when I’ve got assignments I haven’t started. This is too much and it’s destroying me. So I’m going to take steps and cut gaming out of my life. It’ll take a while and a lot of work to fix myself and get rid of this for good but I can’t sit back and destroy myself anymore. I’m going to return this console and finally start doing something right in my life. I’m really deep in the rabbit hole and I feel like such an empty person, I’ve been feeling conflicted the past few days about returning my console but if I don’t I risk destroying myself. I’m grateful for parts of my childhood, the fun I had playing games with my family, friends and those online but I think now is the time I end the chapter. 

If anyone has made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read. I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to about this as I’m really embarrassed by this so I came here. I’m really trying to change my life so if anyone has any advice about addictions, rewiring, or anything related please let me know. I wish everyone the best.",1614941855

Just want to share ig,3,lyehj9,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lyehj9/just_want_to_share_ig/,4,"18m, super addictive personality. Mum and Dad split when I was 3 months because of his drinking and anger issues but we’re still in touch. Not having him present has fucked me up quite a bit, but who’s to say it wouldn’t be worse if he stuck around. From ages 3 to 10 my mom was with a guy that was hooked on crack and cheated on her all the time. Mom and I lived in New Brunswick and he had just moved to B.C. for a job he got with his dad. Mom already knew he had cheated on her but we moved out there with him anyway. This was when she found out about the crack. What made his addiction so much worse is his diabetes, drugs and diabetes are a horrible mix. He’d frequently be gone for days on end binging, only coming home to steal things he could pawn or trade for more crack. He got into a chase with the cops one time and got t-boned on the drivers side. So my mom who was pregnant with his daughter at the time, couldn’t open the drivers side door and had to climb over the passenger seat just to drive to school everyday. This shit went on for a year until we moved back to New Brunswick. He didn’t seem as bad for awhile then suddenly they broke up. I was relieved to have that tension gone in the house, but I also felt guilty for being relieved. I knew nothing about addiction back then but still somehow understood that he was struggling with something and didn’t mean to treat us the way he did.

Fast forward to freshman year of high school I’ve made some new friends and stopped spending as much time with my childhood friends, including my best friend since kindergarten that I clung to. I also started getting really depressed, things just started to look different. I had realized how insecure I actually was, how shitty people can be, how meaningless life can be. I went through seven different antidepressants in a year and a half and wasn’t taking them consistently. Summer of freshman year my best friend moved away without telling me and my new friends basically ghosted me. Halfway through sophomore year I attempted suicide twice. I was taken out of school cause it was stressing me out more and spent half a year isolating at home. All I could ruminate about was how I spent my whole life playing video games and investing in a person who could’ve dropped me out of his life at any moment.

Junior year is when my addiction to video games was switched to drugs. I met my next best friend In an automotive class. We sat together and I never spoke in class but he has ASD and ADHD so he wouldn’t stop talking. He was funny as shit and I could listen to him go for hours. It felt good to have someone that actually wanted to talk to me despite me being so quiet and boring. I started smoking weed with him and his girlfriend at her place after school. I went from trying weed a few times years before to smoking everyday. I met one of his dealers and started buying when I had money. School was starting to get to me again so I stopped going halfway through the year. I became good friends with the dealer and started working for her boyfriend on his farm. I was extremely underpaid but I had enough for weed so I didn’t care. My best friend(I’m just gonna call him Tim cause I’ll probably mention him a lot now) was a year older than me and graduated that summer so he started working on the farm with me. We’d just get baked all day while we picked beans. As senior year was coming closer I got spooked that I wouldn’t be able to afford weed and I didn’t want to get a legit job because then I wouldn’t have time to smoke. I ended up just working at the farm on weekends so I was fine. I tried senior year for maybe a couple weeks then just started coming to school baked every day, I had culinary first period and I was useless. I tried DXM for the first time and used it for a week straight only taking enough to feel crossfaded. COVID hit not long after that and they shutdown the schools. Since there were only a few months left of school they let all the seniors graduate early. I started going to the farm again everyday. One day I convinced my boss to buy me a quart of vodka, he said he’d only buy it for me if I wasn’t too hungover to go to the farm in the morning. So Tim, his gf, and I get plastered at her place and I’m sitting next to her mom babbling when she says “you wanna smoke some DMT?” Miserable experience. I was so drunk I forgot that I smoked it only a few minutes after I did, I didn’t breakthrough of course cause I was still walking but it was messed. I began yelling at Tim and his gf saying I was having psychosis then I passed out in her lap. I knew my use was getting out of hand so I did a 6 month program and came out worse than i was when I arrived. A week after my transition I was smoking and drinking again. I did get a job at a window plant tho so that was good for a couple months, until I stopped going to hangout with Tim’s gf. Tried molly for the first time with her and we were messing around for almost a week. I wanted to get drunk with her, but she decided to invite Tim over last minute. So we all got drunk and I told Tim that we were messing around. I felt sick for what I did and how I ruined our friendship. Next morning I woke up to them cuddling and I already felt like death so I grabbed the quart we were drinking the night before and chugged the rest of it before passing out again. I woke up at 7pm and it was time for me to go home, nothing changed ofc still wanted to die. So I walked home, bought a bunch of Xanax and clazys. Took 4 xans woke up and the 5th one was gone, felt worse because I passed out and didn’t have the chance to enjoy it so I showed some buddy’s the clazys and asked how many to take. They said I got ripped off so I took all 20 of em, I only remember bits and pieces of that day. Next day bought a gram of coke and 8 percs which I got ripped off on too but I didn’t care. Next day bought an 8 ball that turned out to be just baking soda or some shit, bought more molly and it was good. And that was almost three weeks ago. Got a job interview today, haven’t used anything besides weed and liquor since but that’ll change if I get this job. I don’t talk to anyone about this shit so I’m not asking for advice or anything just wanted to get it out there. I don’t want to be sober yet I just hope I’m alive when I change my mind.",1614987472

I didn’t think anyone would take me seriously, but people really had my back. I know I shouldn’t care what people think and do recovery for me, but feeling understood, even by strangers online, was just the boost I needed to really commit to quitting and focus on my health. 

I’m on my 5th day clean. Although this is mostly a psychological battle, my body is definitely feeling the effects of not having a constant flow of anti-anxiety pain killer. I’m sure I’m also feeling the aftermath of the damage I’ve done to my body. 

After reading your comments and doing some research, I decided to get a blood test. I got a call THE NEXT DAY to come in for a B-12 injection. So, can confirm, nitrous definitely screws up your vitamin absorption. I was also severely deficient in other vitamins, probably due to just not caring about eating, and when I did eat, not paying attention to nutrition. I’m taking a load of gummy vitamins now. 

I have tingling / numbness in my toes that I stupidly did not put 2&2 together until I did some reading. It’s not painful, but I do really hope it goes away. I’m definitely clumsier, I lose my balance more easily, drop things, run into walls, etc. I fumble my words a lot almost like I’ve developed some kind of stutter I never had before. Worst of all is the brain fog in general. I used to be a real summa-cum-laude smarty pants, and I just feel dumb in a way that’s hard to articulate. My thinking is less creative and critical. My memory is worse. 

Anyway, I just wanted to update and express my gratitude. Hopefully these details might help someone else searching for info like I was.",1614977703
Seeking Advice on Cell Phone Addiction,2,lyfehn,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lyfehn/seeking_advice_on_cell_phone_addiction/,0,"Hey everyone. I was wondering where would be a good place to reach out to regarding this situation and after some browsing came upon this community and figured it may be the best place to look for the advice I’ve been seeking. It’s a bit of a long read, sorry in advance and thanks to anyone who takes the time.

So a bit of background: I’m 27, male. I’ve been dealing with moderate/severe depression and anxiety most of my life that I attribute to growing up in an incredibly unhealthy home environment. I’ve smoked weed on a daily basis for the past 11 or so years as a way of coping with this depression. A few years ago I met the woman who would become my wife, and since then things have (for the most part) improved drastically.

I’ve finished school, moved out of my parents basement, got a well paying job and my wife and I have purchased a house. Being away from home and on my own I didn’t really deal with the same emotions anymore that I was smoking all the time to escape, but I continued smoking copiously, out of habit I feel at that point. When I caught myself sneaking away from my wife to hide smoking, I decided to stop. After numerous attempts to fully stop, I’ve made it about 10 days sober so far and the cravings have stopped.

My current issues are that I feel a strong addiction to my phone, and a genera lack of interest in hobbies and activities I once loved. My screen time statistics are 8.5 hours a day according to my phone. I’m not always actively looking, but whether I’m working or doing just about anything I’ll have a YouTube video in in the background or something. Now that I’m not smoking weed, I feel a lot more aware that I’m just wasting my time with the phone. I’ve tried to limit my time and have had some success at times, but I feel cravings to use my phone almost constantly when I’m not on it, and things just don’t feel right to me if there’s not some type of audio, generally from a YouTube video, in the background. The videos I listen to are usually podcasts or something similar, but I don’t absorb any of the info because it’s essentially background noise to me.

I was wondering if anyone has experienced this type of feeling of addiction to their phone, and if they could offer me some type of advice as to how they’ve been able to overcome it. I feel that it’s made my ability to focus go to shit, my attention span is much shorter, and I generally don’t feel as sharp as I used to. If anyone’s still reading at this point I truly appreciate it. And I appreciate any responses",1614989968

I appreciate you for reading through my situation.

&#x200B;

I am 29 years old, almost 30... born and raised in Arizona so I know nothing else. My parents never married, they met in rehab actually, DOC was cocaine. My father liked to shoot up, but was currently a counselor; my mom was a snorter and she was a patient. They ran away from treatment, and not long after, I was born. I'm likely a lusty 'feels like love' drug-fueled binge baby. He was cheating on her, so she left him in Tennessee to come home to AZ. She later met Jeff, my step dad, and remarried to later have two more children together, girls. He hated me, I wasn't his child, so I wasn't included or accepted and well, it damaged me. I have daddy issues along with the feeling like I never fit in anywhere.

IDK what my issue is, but more than half of my exes were addicts. I have dabbled, but overall managed to get out unscathed... Here's the general breakdown:  
1. Bryan: First \[real\] boyfriend, he wasn't an active addict when we were together, but afterwards became an addict, went to jail, was on Dog the Bounty Hunter at one point. I think he turned his life around & has a baby now but not sure...  
2. Derek: Dated in high school, met on Myspace, went to diff. schools. Wasn't an addict when dating, but ended up becoming one within a year of us splitting, he is now deceased due to an OD. Friends of his shot him up & left him to die in a park bathroom.  
3. Coty: This dude was a trip! Claimed to have narcolepsy & would crash out everywhere. Ppl later told me he was an addict, I recall he got heroin once saying it was 'hash' like weed & I tried it with him & HATED IT THANK GOODNESS. No clue where he ended up.  
4. Mike: Met through mutual friends, he hated coke & weed but drank a shit ton. He was addicted to mentols, xbox live, nyquil, & vodka. He got better! Seems to be fine now!  
5. Seth: Met at work, he was in recovery. Moved in together & that's all she wrote, heroin addict. Started using hardcore, stole my money, couldn't pay bills, cheated. Turned out gay.  
6. Joel: Alcoholic. Grew & sold shrooms, did way too many while dating. Cheater. Almost killed me, I heard he dated an addict after me & got into drugs. Not sure where hes at...  
7. Tyler: Was locked up prior to us dating, was the cool older neighborhood kid, knew his family. Got out, got together, he was so amazing, until his friend got outta jail & they used together, spiraled from there, currently in prison.  
8. Christian: College educated, attractive. Was an addict in recovery, but was secretly using when we started dating. Did acid together & was fully back into the drug world. (Current)

I have empathy for addicts, and that's great, but why do I always date them?

Prior to now, I struggled with holding jobs, paying my way through life, being honest, etc. I worked for Ring as a Training coach for 3 years and it changed and saved my life. I finally was an adult with great work ethic, and overall positive outlook. 

In the beginning, we texted about everything, all the time, super in depth and romantic convos too... he'd disappear for days at a time \[blaming depression\] and that was likely when using and feeling shameful. We ended up getting together and he started methadone to stay away from addiction. He was taking klonopin, and I went with it disregarding the red flags.

I have been mentally destroyed since then. He blamed me for using, he has talked inappropriately to other people while we were together, takes off on me for hours, lies, lets random people into our lives and home that end up having bad intentions, you name it. Everything but hit me. He harps on me for things I am insecure about, and has slowly destroyed my image of myself & my mental health.

I ended up having a mental breakdown, I almost was committed to a psych ward. I started therapy, and meds. I put my foot down, he seemed receptive.

He then said that my mental breakdown was a muse to distract him from messages that he claims to have found in my phone. He made a huge deal out of things that were not involving him, etc.

The worst was the fact that one minute, we are perfect, the next, he hates me & wants nothing to do with me, says I ruined his life... I was ready to let him go...

He then went to detox, he reached out to his family & asked for help. He went to detox for a week and then came home, he was supposed to go to treatment after but he says something about covid \[Idk whats true, whats not\] but the first day he got out, he asked me for money. He said he needed to use again in order to get back into rehab & treatment again & I am an idiot and gave in so he didn't try to figure out money all day in some shady ass way & stays gone all day \[he knows that works\].

He has spent the past 20 hours smoking fent & blues & nodding off on himself. His parents want him to stay at his dads while waiting for rehab, and I'm cool with that.

He left tonight claiming his dad wanted to have a talk, says that I couldn't go. He says he's gonna be smoking weed so warned that he'd be out of it....

The fact that he informed me of so many details makes me not believe him...

He's been gone for 3 hours now, he said his dad works at 4am so going to bed at 11pm seems unrealistic to me. Of course, he stops answering his phone for a lot of it....

I messaged his dad asking that he tell me when he leaves...

I guess if he didn't go, I'll find out.

I've been addicted to nitrous oxide for close to six years now. It's gotten pretty bad. To the point where I blow entire paychecks, spend all day/night doing it, getting sick, telling people off, ect. I absolutely hate it. I've tried several times to stop. I tell myself often that I need to stop. i've even thrown out the devices used to get high (canister)...I just keep on getting more. I live three minutes away from the smoke shop that sells it. I take money from my parents, friends, and I want/need help. 

I've tried calling a few rehab places, but they are too expensive for me, even with insurance. I do have a therapist, and psychiatrist. They both know about this. I do suffer from depression, c-PTSD, bipolar, ADHD, social anxiety, and type 1 diabetes. I know why I do it, but getting out has been one of the hardest things I have felt. I want to stop. I know all the bad side-effects, horror stories, it doesn't stop me...I always fear I am going to die every time I do it. I don't want to do this crap anymore.",1614936146

It's super easy to relapse, but every time I do it gets easier and easier to say no the next time. Maybe I'm just not done with cigarettes and marijuana but I'll never stop trying to stop.

It has been a repetitive cycle for the last 6 years of my realizing/ discovering he is lying about it, me being mad and upset, him getting quick fix of help, then him doing well for a bit, life gets stressful and then back at it. 

Today, I (39f) watched him drink a beer on the porch, while on the phone. He thought I was still at work, wasn’t aware I had been home for 30 minutes in the house. He has supposedly been sober for 3 months. He realized I was watching and then hid it behind his back like a child. I walked out and dumped it over the railing, while i was fuming mad, i told him to leave. He laughed at me. All the while he is still on the phone. 
After a very heated argument, where he blamed it all on me and brought up a situation where I lied 12 years ago. I apologized profusely and took all the blame to end the argument . He sat in the car in the driveway for the next 4 hours and is now in the guest bed. Obviously, I could have handled it better, but sheer anger took hold of me. 

Iam not so mad at the alcohol, its the sneaking, hiding and lying that makes me furious. 

As a partner, how are these wounds healed, if ever?  

Clearly, I cant force him to get help, since no amount of conversation, crying, screaming or ultimatums have ever worked in a meaningful way. Maybe, its time I focus on helping myself through how to reconcile what Ive been through. I have struggled to pay for private therapy in the past to have it be consistent.

My mother’s addiction and the journey I’ve been on,1,ly0g3l,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ly0g3l/my_mothers_addiction_and_the_journey_ive_been_on/,1,"I’m posing this in hope for someone to reply, weather it is advice, someone who relates or it would be quite interesting to hear an psychologists point of view. 

I’m 21 year old woman now and I’ve not seen my mother in a few months probably about 5 months since last speaking but that’s pretty normal for us to go Christmas’ without each other, birthdays etc. 

It’s been a while since she’s actually been a mother to me, it’s been around 9 years to be exact. When I was about 12 that’s when she just kind of gave up with her whole life, including us, her children, her appearance (teeth starting to deteriorate, loosing a lot of weight, not taking care of her self like she used to, housework out the window. Depressed mum.

Her addiction is with amphetamines mainly. It began to grow the more ill my niece got apparently to her but then she Denys being addicted or being on it when she is on the drug and high at the time. She’s smokes cannabis but I do to.
She’s been taking this for about 15 years now, the amphetamines, base. Effects are showing more the bigger her addiction has gotten.

Around 13 she would lock me out of the house after school, no answer after knocking at the door for 15 mins, no money in my pocket, I would walk to my sisters house who was around 19 at the time with a disabled baby girl, who had a brain genetic disorder.Life was tough.

My mother never had nothing around that time unemployed, we struggled financially, she has bi polar which she doesn’t take medication for or get any sort of treatment. Since my niece died, then her brother died suddenly a year after with a drug overdose (complete shock to us all). 

The year after she lost the man who brung her up let’s call him George to cancer it was instantly terminal. Her biological father as well passed away to within weeks. She has a tenancy of acting wild at family funerals but that’s another story.
She never made it to my grandad George’s funeral. So a lot of bereavement was going on in the family. 

My dad and his wife took me in around 13, so I never seen my mother as I was living with them. If I did it a briefly. She lived near the school shops and I would always feel embarrassed when people or my friends had any encounters with her as she was either so high on speed. I was embarrassed by her behaviour and the way she would go on like a junkie. I was embarrassed my mother had her priority’s wrong.
Life was really good while I was with dad, was spoiled with my own beautiful
room, wifi which my mother doesn’t have, until I got an Asian boyfriend and my dad was racist and I ended back in my mams toxic household.

My best friend let’s call her Ava I met her around high school time, her and her mum took me in for long time as they figured my home life wasn’t great, they would make me hot meals every night after school, I would shower or take bubble baths there, I lived well there. Ava was moving away, so I got a school teacher to help me as I was homeless at 16. 

I luckily got a bedsit, from a homeless charity for young people. My ‘mother’ never once visited although it was down the road. Never made an effort to see me or care for me or even wonder what I was 

Then I would have the odd contact with her like every 6 month where I would go to visit her out of guilt for her mental illness but she’d be out her head on speed. 

As the years went on the worse my mother and her addiction got, constantly paranoid about our neighbours watching us and listening to us, even paranoid about her boyfriends having listening devices in her house, then it went to spiders invisible spiders all over her house, telling people she needs to move out, then she told us she was pregnant she had a bump and then rang my auntie and said she was pregnant with a spider I’m about 19 when she’s saying all of this. 

I seen her one night, spent some time with her and went home with my boyfriend, at the time, who lived not far from her. 
She knew we had weed, and text me to come back around with a joint which I never because it was like 1am - so she came around and shared knocking on our bedroom window as we were in a downstairs flat, banging in our door for about 10 whole minutes, she gave up after we never answered. 
I woke up with all of my baby and childhood pictures of me posted through the door with horrible nasty messages such as “ugly spotty meff” “slag” “don’t fucking ever contact me again” knowing as my mother I was struggling with acne. 

Even after all of this I turned up in November with chocolates, flowers, a card and most importantly showed up with my love and support in hopes she would want to change and get help with getting clean and having the right support system around her, but instead she chose to kick off, be verbal and told us to get out her house and leave her alone.

3 week xanex use withdrawal,1,ly0cc4,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ly0cc4/3_week_xanex_use_withdrawal/,1,"Hey everyone.  I’m a 29 y/o male with substance abuse history.  I started taking klonopin on and off about 2.5 months ago.  Not every day, would sometimes go days without them.  Dosing anywhere from 2-4 mg per day.  Well 3 weeks ago I decided to call a doctor and got an RX for xanex.  Started at .25 3x day.  I probably finished that bottle in 3 days.  She then upped it the next week to .5mg which again I took in 3-4 days.  I went 60 hours without last week and had some anxiety but could sleep and it wants unbearable.  I picked up my last script which was a 2 week supply and took 18mg in 5-6 days.  Knew I was abusing so said I’d had enough.  Gave the few remaining pills to my dad and tried to stop.  The next day I was miserable, depressed, low energy, and at about 36 hours i began feeling withdrawal.  Anxiety on the verge of panic, increased heart rate, and a feeling of dissociation(this was not severe but was very alarming to me) I then began to read all of the horror stories of benzo withdrawal and had no idea it could be so bad.  I’m hoping the fact that it has only been a few weeks on the stuff and sporadic use before will help.  Please no “your a junkie comments”. Addiction is a disease and just looking for anyone with similar experience.

Also,  i take Kratom and tried stopping that cold turkey as well.. I think I’m going to do an outpatient detox with Librium.  Anyone have experience with short term xanex use and a quick taper with a longer acting benzo???",1614935240

I just recently found out it’s been a problem because he has been getting braver with the amount he takes. I have been catching him slipping and it just full blown fucked up. Well last week he blacked out from Thursday afternoon till Saturday morning when I was picking him up from jail. Week before last we had a sit down with his parents and he talked about how he was going to stop and how he doesn’t really have a problem. Then last week he ended up in jail. I thought that would really open his eyes that his world can crash and burn. He’s facing a dui and potentially a HUGE drug charge because of the dumbass people he was with. Well then last night I come home and can tell he was on something again so I had to be the psycho gf and go look for shit. Of course I found it. He wanted to make me happy and call these rehab places but they want him to come in for 30+ days in patient and he won’t do it. Has anyone been able to kick the habit without treatment? I read that if you take benzos on the regular you kinda need to wean yourself off.. should I be in control of the pills and wean him off? I tried being the supporter and letting him know I’m here but he keeps letting me down. We have a kid on the way. I live with him in KY and have started a life here. I’ve dealt with drugs my whole life both my parents are drug addicts and still are. Neither one of them have been able to kick their habit and I’m scared he won’t be able to either. I’m do in 3 months.... if I can’t get him the help he needs I’m going to be raising my kid on my own I won’t have this in my kids life. I made that promise to myself when I was 8 lol. If anyone has any recommendations on how or what to do I would GREATLY appreciate it!!

Bf in rehab for marijuana addiction bought cocaine from another addict in rehab,1,lxy6tg,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lxy6tg/bf_in_rehab_for_marijuana_addiction_bought/,7,"My bf (23 M) just started outpatient rehab for his marijuana addiction about a month ago. My boyfriend just admitted to me tonight before his meeting that he blew over $150 on cocaine and has used it multiple times throughout the day from Monday (his first therapy session of the week until last night when he ran out). Before this, he had only done it once or twice over 2 years ago with a friend. He said that another addict in his group basically went up to all of the addicts that are not clean yet offering to sell them coke and my boyfriend is impulsive due to having ADHD and bought a lot. He now owes him money and has to pay the rest of his dues at group therapy tonight. 

I (23 F) am trying my best to understand what he is going through but I am terrified that he is going to be replacing his weed addiction with an even worse one. It makes me wonder if group therapy is even a good thing now. I tried to give him advice which was to tell his counselor about it and how he is trying to sell to other unclean addicts. It just gets on my nerves that this other addict is basically going to rehab in my opinion to find easy targets that are struggling to get better. My bf doesnt want to speak to the counselor and bring up his name because he is scared of confrontation. I just don’t know what to do anymore and if I can trust him anymore. 

Do you guys think it is reasonable to tell his counselor about this guy and how he is approaching others. I am sure if he mentioned he did not want to be named or singled out that it would not cause any issues. I just don’t know what to do or how to help him.",1614928560

In-patient nightmare.,2,lxrgp3,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lxrgp3/inpatient_nightmare/,1,"This is a long but fucked up story. I wouldn’t even know how to TL;DR this. Please read if you’re considering seeking detox along with an in-patient program.

About two weeks ago I entered a detox facility where I stayed for roughly 5 days before being transferred to a long term program that would last until March 15th. 

At the long term facility there were many red flags that appeared pretty quickly. For example, I was only allowed two monitored and recorded calls to my husband per week. I reported sexual harassment that I witnessed in a group therapy session as well as Ableist slurs that didn’t sit well with me. 

I found out that none of my complaints were actually recorded and that’s when I demanded to leave. I was “allowed” to make one phone call to my husband that night because it happened to be our anniversary. He could tell something was wrong based on certain words I used and the tone of my voice. He asked, “if you needed to call 911, could you?” The tech monitoring the call immediately made me disconnect. 

I was told that if I left against medical advice from their facility they would hold ALL of my personal belongings (phone, money, clothes, meds) for 48 hours per the intake agreement. They literally said I would be out on the curb for 48 hours with NOTHING.

The next day they tell me that they have a new facility for me and that I could transfer out within an hour and I jumped at the chance. 

I was picked up by the new facility transport and was then taken to a completely different address than was was noted on my discharge papers.

The building ended up being a halfway house in the SCARIEST part of town close to Miami. I was so confused and scared and was not allowed to call my husband until I signed all of their paperwork to check in. I refused, knowing that something was deeply wrong. They gave me my personal belongings as they had no legal right to have them at that point. I packed for a month before entering the first facility (detox) just incase, so I had a lot of stuff that I could barely carry.

I sat, in the dark, on a curb, behind a car and waited for an Uber to come take me to a hotel.

My gut told me that I was about to be purposefully lost in the system as they refused to tell my husband where they were taking me. In fact, the long term facility told him I would transfer the following day instead of that night.

I would encourage you to read up on the prevalence of sex trafficking from addiction facilities in Florida.

I was SCARED for my life. I didn’t sleep at the hotel that night while I waited for my husband to get me in the morning. I was convinced that someone may have followed the Uber to see where I would be.

I will NEVER allow myself to go to in patient treatment ever again. I was literally scared straight. I’ll never touch alcohol again. I’m 14 days sober today.

EDIT: I will not name these facilities directly but I will share the towns in which they were located and you can draw your own conclusions. The facility that moved me to an unknown location is known for wrangling in out of state patients. There were maybe two or three of us from Florida there. Both that facility and the unknown location are in Lake Worth, Florida and the detox was in Orlando, Florida.

Hi. Could really use some help,1,lxua4w,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lxua4w/hi_could_really_use_some_help/,15,"Hi. First time posting here and really hope someone can help point me in the right direction. My brother is a heroin addict. He has been using on and off for a few years. He is at a point where he wants to get help but we cannot afford rehab and he does not have insurance. I am at a loss for what to do and am desperate to find help. 

The most ideal situation (I think) would be to get him to a rehab center, but those are very expensive and we are not sure how we would cover the expenses. 

I have thought about inviting him to live with me, but last time that happened, he stole money from me and used my house for drug deals. It did not seem to help, but rather enable him to use in a situation that was more comfortable. I also am concerned about his safety while he is quitting as I know the withdrawals can be painful and dangerous without supervision. 

I am hoping for advice about our options. Is quitting cold turkey an option? I assume it is not, but I am not sure what other options we have.

Sorry if this is a common post in this sub. I really need help for him and pray someone can share their insight with me. Thank you",1614918264

Dad has been addicted to amphetamines for 20+ years,57,lx18bx,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lx18bx/dad_has_been_addicted_to_amphetamines_for_20_years/,33,"My \[33M\] Dad \[60M\] has been addicted to methamphetamines for more than the past 2 decades. His trouble started way back in 1997 when he was arrested for trafficking large quantities of methamphetamines. At this time, dealing drugs was his way of supplementing his habit. As a result of this, he lost his government job, his marriage, and caused a massive rift within the family. He was able to circumvent any prison time by withdrawing his government pension and hiring the best attorney he could find. While his affiliated associates received several years of time in prison, my Dad skated by with 2 years of house arrest and 7 years of probation. 

Over the years he has attended at least 5 rehabilitation programs (some inpatient, some outpatient), relapsed several times, and been arrested 4 more times for violating the terms of his probation. There have been periodic episodes where I have no doubt in my mind that he was clean. He adhered to a normal sleep schedule, he began a successful consulting business, the ~~loser junkie~~ addict friends stopped coming around, he adopted new hobbies and passions, he spent time with his children \[33M, 30M, 23F\], and remarried.

In 2005, during the time in which I was 100% convinced that he was clean, I caught him snorting something off of his briefcase while sitting in the cab of his truck. I was devastated. He had come so far and was happily living life as a business owner (with more money than he knew what to do with) and his new wife. I confronted him about this immediately and while he showed genuine remorse and guilt, I can't be certain that he has had any moments of sobriety since then. 

In the years that have passed, I have grown up, finished college, started my own family and gradually distanced myself from him and his destructive behavior. I forever consigned myself to the notion that my Dad would always be a drug addict; rather than confronting him about his abuse I just put up my walls and instead decided that I would control the capacity to which he was involved with my family (limited). This strategy worked well for several years. I insulated myself from having to deal with the heartache surrounding his drug abuse by ignoring it all together and instead focused on providing a life for my family. 

This plan backfired early in 2020 when my disabled younger brother \[30M\] was admitted to the hospital for a fluid-filled sac in his testicle that required surgery. My Dad took my brother to the hospital, but the attending physician noticed that something was awry with both my Dad and my brother; they were acting out of sorts. Based on this hunch, the doctor ordered a drug test which revealed that my disabled younger brother tested positive for methamphetamines. \[Note: my brother does not have access to his own income, nor does he have access to his own transportation, so the likelihood that he obtained the methamphetamines on his own is highly unlikely.\]

I confronted my Dad about this and like the coward he is, he ran away before I could punch him in the teeth like he deserved. This was the last straw for his second marriage. She kicked him out and filed for divorce. Homeless and unemployed, he took up residence in an abandoned travel trailer in the middle of the woods on the destitute property of what I can only assume is another ~~junkie~~ addict. A few months pass and Dad calls in the middle of the night, sounding barely alive and on the brink of death. He seemed to be completely unaware that there was a global pandemic occurring and there was a good chance that he contracted the coronavirus. I urged him to call an ambulance and go to the hospital.

He called me after being admitted to the hospital and gleefully informed me ""the Doctor says I have COVID, I'm just glad it's not the coronavirus!"" This perfectly exemplifies how delusional and disconnected he was from the world in which we all live; he didn't know that COVID = coronavirus. Over the next 5 days in the hospital, we can only presume that he went through all of the stages of drug withdrawal. He would call us in the middle of the night complaining about games of Scrabble that were stuck in his head, lamenting on time lost with his family, and crying about how he wanted to change his life. We were elated. Perhaps this was the ""rock bottom"" that so many speak of.

With a renewed sense of purpose and direction, the family began searching for rehab options for an unemployed 60 year old man with no health insurance, medicare, medicaid, etc. My sister navigated this process and found a rehab program that would accept him once he could demonstrate that he had a negative COVID test. Against the wishes of my wife and family, I drove to the hospital once he was discharged and drove him to a nearby motel where I checked him into a room to quarantine for the next week so he could get a clean COVID test. My sister bought him clothes. I stopped by every night and brought him food until one day, he was gone.

Irate, I called him only to discover that he had his friend ""Crystal"" come pick him up. He indicated that he had no recollection of the obvious plan in motion for him to enter a rehab program and chalked up all of the midnight phone calls sobbing in tears from the hospital to side effects from the laborious toll that COVID had taken on his body. He was clueless that we had been bending over backwards to help him and ditched the idea before he even gave it a chance. We cut him off completely.

Due to our relatively uncommon last name, his ~~junkie~~ addict friends took to Facebook and began reaching out to me to tell me of all of his exploits. Apparently he was selling drugs out of his trailer compound, shacked up with a thirty-something ~~pillhead~~ drug user. My Dad inadvertently sent a text message to my brother that was embedded with all kinds of ""code words"". He talked of ""being 30 minutes out with the coffee beans"" (pills) and that he didn't have any money but he could bring a ""winchester 20 gauge pump shotty"" or maybe a ""lady trade for gen"" (prostitution?).

Months pass and he calls like nothing has happened, asking about my daughter's upcoming 1 year old birthday party, to which he was neither invited nor welcomed.  We told him that we have an absolute zero tolerance policy when it comes to him, his drugs, and our family. 

To this day, he refuses to acknowledge that he is using drugs and instead points to all of the incredible things that he has done for other people. Did you know that this Christmas he bought a bicycle for a little black boy from the hood? Did you know that ""Crystal"", the very girl that picked him up from the hotel, was once a pill addicted ~~junkie~~ addict and he gradually weaned her off dilaudid and she now lives like the Brady Bunch with her family? Did you know that every person in his life judges him unfairly for using methamphetamines because we recreationally smoke marijuana?

We are all fed up with his delusional mindset. Rant over.

Around this time i lost my mother and over the course of 8 years i lost more than 9 loved ones who were close to me, wether it be through terminal illness, bad luck, and overdose. I lost most of my role models and people i would confide in when in need. Since the loss of my mother ages 10-13 i began drinking alcohol I’d steal from my friends alcoholic parents, smoking pot also given to us by parents, and taking oxy and hyrdros which we would get by frequently breaking into trailers of older people’s houses while they were away, also developed smoking cigarettes as well. When i was 13 i moved away from my home to another state. Without these things i felt empty and would often steal my dads cigarettes to slightly feel anything i used to. Fast forward to 16 i finally found friends, started drinking and smoking again. While i felt they did it for fun and i just wanted to fit in, i always knew i did for the purpose of pushing down my feelings. Around 17 i found pills again and over the course of a year i went overboard with them, but i never spoke to anyone about the addiction i had then or in the past, every time i did it i was hoping maybe it could all just end peacefully. I eventually was able to get myself off of them, this coming with the price of me completely becoming a extremely heavy pot smoker, the last 2 1/2 years i was so baked i wasn’t even myself anymore. Though I’ve always been confused on that my entire life. I’m 20 now and due to me getting a serious job I’ve done my best to give it all up. Often times now though i feel drawn back to the pills and alcohol even more being sober, pot kept those feelings away for so long. It’s like a craving, even though I’m much more happy now i just have days i feel like I’m in a cage i can’t get out of, that i might be a step closer to going back harder than ever, and i don’t want that. I don’t want to fuck up what i have now. I’ve been damaged for years now and addiction was in me from such a young age. I despise social media outlets, but I’m on here hoping to find answers and help.

I truly feel like a teenager starting from scratch today. 

30 is growing closer every day. I know that the only way out is through and that if I start making an effort now, I will be better off in a few years. It could STILL all be okay. I could still get the things I want and need out of life. I just didn't expect that the hardest part of recovery is you have to confront all the things you avoid. Like, fuck. Where has my head been?

Annnnyway, if anyone has kind words or stories about feeling a similar way, and even if you could just let me know where you're at now. I want to know it's possible to create a good, thriving life at 28, starting from scratch. Feel free to dm me if you don't want to share here. Thanks!",1614835171

I have so many and conflicting emotions.

1) Fucking finally. I binge eat, have been on and off the wagon since I officially got sober in 2018, think about drugs every day (like the molly my roommate has in the lock box I got her. If it wasnt in there, I would have stolen it already). I’m really grateful for this extra help. I feel like I might be able to start creating a normal life away from addictions.

2) But.

I wont be able to get high? I technically still smoke thc and would like to not but it’s been such a security blanket. Freaking out a little too long? Weed. Feeling weird? Weed. Cant think of anything to actually do? Weed. Do have things to do? Weed. Etc

The 10yo me that has been self medicating (31 now) is SCREAMING.

What will I do without my go-to drugs? Like, even if I went to them, they *supposably* wont do anything for me anymore.

What about CBD?

What do you think is going on with my friend?,3,lx54np,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lx54np/what_do_you_think_is_going_on_with_my_friend/,6,"So I know this guy who used to be an addict. He moved away and went through all kinds of addiction treatment, got sober and seemed to be doing good for a few years. But eventually I started noticing behavior of him slipping a little. He got into gambling which seems to be somewhat common for people in recovery. I didn't really think much of it, especially because he was into poker and stuff before he was ever an addict. He also was doing testosterone but I didn't think much of that either. I did start to wonder if he was bending his view on sobriety a little. 

But then he started getting involved with drugs. Not using them to my knowledge, but seemingly wanting to be around them. He started to say his friend wanted weed etc, and asked me if I could get weed for his friend. I hung out with him another time and he brought Molly over that his neighbor had. He was basically pushing me to do the molly, but didn't do any with me. That same night I had weed and he said his friend wanted some and so I gave him some and he said he would pay me back. Keep in mind, although I do use drugs I never would ask him to do anything or even take anything out around him. I respected his sobriety and didn't want to see him relapse. After giving him the weed he ghosted me for several weeks. It kinda pissed me off because it was like $200 worth. I kept texting him but no answer. Eventually I asked him if he relapsed and that seemed to get a response. After that he answered me and said he was out of town or some bullshit but finally paid me the money. Since then though, he wants nothing to do with me. I used to hang out with him all the time. He even left this speaker at my house which is worth $100 and just never comes to get it. 

What do you think is going on exactly? Did he relapse and is unwilling to accept reality? Or is he bending his own rules a little and doesn't like that I see his behavior as a cause for concern? What do you think?",1614836549

Maybe your mom, dad, siblings, cousins, partner, a friend, a child, someone.



I want you to know that even though you might have betrayed these people in awful ways, you are still loved by them.




You decided to get cleaned up. Maybe it was not the first time, maybe you thought you could control it, the reasons don't matter.


What matters right now, today, is that you are here ready to make some small change, baby steps toward a better life.. Don't slip, don't slide back, not even once.


Your life is literally the most precious thing you have. Even if you are in pain and think death would be better, let me tell you, selfishly it's not better.


It's not better for me. It's not better for our parents, it's not better for our siblings, it's not better for your kids, it's not better for your wife. It's not better for your friends. Even your in-laws, they're destroyed.


You were such a big, loving, goofy wild man who I watched grow up and never did you lose our childhood wildness. I lost mine and I needed yours injected into my life to remind me how free it can be.




I need you to be one of ""us"", when the families take sides in things, you always took our family side. We were solid against the others.. Now it's just me and the little one. We need our tallest ally for having our backs.
Her and I are tough, but our brother had more fearlessness and could say what needed to be said.




You got better, things were looking good. But a little fight sent you back to that demon and I didn't know. You could have called me that night. I would have understood why she was mad and I would have been sympathetic to your reasons and I would have told you how much of a battle you were fighting and I was proud of you. But you chose that tiny little piece of what looks like dirt, wrapped in foil and everything else you could have ever been or done went up in smoke with it.

But each single creeping day my alcohol addiction is eating away at everything I love, and forcing myself to take everything I care for away from me. 

Each day I feel more and more like Sisyphus, the person from Roman Mythology, who was punished by Zeus with the impossible task of carrying a heavy stone to the top of a mountain. Only to find himself almost reaching the top, realizing the stone was too heavy to carry and to see it fall down the slope on the other side of the mountain. He kept up his impossible task until he died. I feel like each day I have to start all over, and carry my burden of shame, resentment and fear over what's happening right now to my own tipping point. And the sad part is, I really feel like I'm going to make it that day. My stone tips over and slides back down when I have to go to sleep, and I don't want to try to carry the burden again tomorrow.

Though Im not addicted to anything in particular, I still feel like if someone offered me anything I’d take it. A few people in my life disregard my drug use and still ask where to get things or invite me to do drugs with them which is really hard to say no to (Im proud I have been able to recently). I also went through a very traumatic event recently and I just want to block it out which means going back to old habits.
I do want to get better cause I’m so young and I want to get past this but its very difficult especially when those around me disregard my problems with drug use. I have been consistent with rehab but its hard to just stop when its all I’ve known for the past two years. If anyone has advice I would really appreciate it :-)",1614775788

so i got out of rehab late july, felt really confident in staying sober, tayed sober for a while, had a small relapse in september, stopped using for a while, then only used once a week. until late january 2021 i relapsed big time with my two top drugs of choice and have spent hundreds of dollars all throughout february and haven’t been able to go more than 2 days without using since i relapsed. it’s all i think about. 

i plan on stopping again this week but i have no faith in myself and know i’m probably going to relapse. because no matter how much i want to be sober, my brain has that part where it always wants to use no matter what, however much money or how much i have to lie, hide and hurt myself and others. 

i feel like i’m in the same place i was back in march-june last year when my addiction was the absolute worst. at what point should i go back to rehab? i want to be sober but have no support and feel like i have no control. i would like some opinions to help straighten out my head and figure out what to do.",1614684965

And i smoke. Since 2016 regulary, but m'y first time with nicotine was in 2012.

Smoking is not much of a taboo at home. Before moving in with my GF (22F), I smoked at home, be it in my room, in the attic, on the garden's terrace,... but my GF don't know. She believe that i stopped in 2019, and now that i live with her, i just stopped smoking at home. I still smoke at work, when i walk alone and now, at midnight in the ""garden"".

I think my boyfriend is in danger and IDK exactly how to act.,2,lvhh3i,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lvhh3i/i_think_my_boyfriend_is_in_danger_and_idk_exactly/,5,"Hi !

I really need to talk about this and I'm a bit afraid to ask support from my friends/family.

(I apologize for my english, it may be tough to read, this isn't my native language)

I have myself dealt with addiction (alcohol and benzodiazepines) a few years ago, so I think I know some basics about recovering and the kind of things I might/might not say to somebody. My uncle have been an heroin addict and now he's really fucked up, he got some kind of paranoid personnality disorder and this thing affected me a lot (during my childhood and still a bit now).

Well, I knew at the time I met my boyfriend one year and a half ago that he had some addiction issues in the past (especially with cocaine). He may have an ADHD, and I'm sure he's an high IQ person, so he's very sensitive in general and exposed to addictions.

We live about 600km away from each other and we can't meet rn, so I try to help from a distance. When we're together, we sometimes do drugs (dissociatives). I'm able to control myself (only once a week, taking the right amount) and he ""mimics"" me when I'm with him. But when I go... That's an other story.

He's been using at least one of the following : 2FDCK, DMXE, 3HO PCP, alcohol and cocaine every night since I got home last week. Most of the time, he's alone, but when he's out, the friends he's seeing those days are really into cocaine.

I know he was in denial so I expressed my concerns about this a few days ago. He told me he won't take anything before moving (he's got a new place only 3h away from mine, he's anxious about moving, and It's about to be the anniversary of his mom who died when he was only 7), but now he's seeing his friends again tonight. So I know he's gonna at least take cocaine and alcohol. I won't blame him but I'm feeling very axious. I told him to text me if he feels the situation may get out of control. He's ok with that.

Last time he fell asleep and I had no news for like 17hours and I thought he may be dead.

Things really turned grey in a short amount of time. He's gonna be alone in his new place soon, with no friends, and I'm afraid things are going to get darker and darker for him.

He's in the other hand okay to get some help from professionals, I told him I could help with reasearches and phonecalls if he needs to. He's okay with that. So that's the crack for the light to come in.

I don't want him to hide stuff from me, I told him I won't get mad if he takes stuff even I'm worried. But I still have my life and my own problems, I can't be available 24/24 for him.

Do you have tips ? How could I help him properly without beeing too involved ?

Leaving him isn't an option. I love him and I'm ready to deal with this. But I'm sensitive too. So I don't know my boundaries...

Thanks for reading

Have a nice day/evening",1614654450
Advice needed on old friend who may be trying to OD,1,lvmssx,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lvmssx/advice_needed_on_old_friend_who_may_be_trying_to/,6,"So my friend and I had a falling out so blocked each other. On my device, I still actually received blocked messages, they just automatically get sent to a spam folder. By default I had notifications on for these blocked messages for whatever reason, so it tells you that somebody you've blocked sent you a message but not who or the content.

I saw at the time that they had sent me something (for whatever reason despite them knowing they had been blocked) but I didn't open it for a couple of days until curiosity got the better of me. Just in case they're here (low chance but not extremely low), I'm going to keep this somewhat vague but if needed I have a screenshot of what they've said. Essentially, they said they took five times the recommended dose, then ostensibly did it again on the weekend (i.e. around two days ago) and is planning to do it but even more extreme next weekend (I feel a bit bad because I may have been able to prevent the ostensible second OD had I seen the message immediately and had never blocked them). The pills in question are suspected to be benzos, as they currently receive these legitimately via prescription.

Haven't broached this with them yet. How do I go about doing this? I am not near enough to talk to them in person but I know somebody who is if needs be. Or do I go to a family member? Google hasn't helped much here.

I know I have a problem. I need help determining if I’m an addict.,2,luzbyg,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/luzbyg/i_know_i_have_a_problem_i_need_help_determining/,3,"
Never really thought about the word applying to me before. I’ve worried in the past that I had alcoholic tendencies, and I used to abuse alcohol pretty regularly. In college I smoked a ton of weed, even past the point where I started getting paranoid. I didn’t really enjoy it, but it was a form of self-medicating that I would do. I tried a bunch of other shit in college, too, but a lot of people do so I never thought anything was problematic. 

Moved away, found myself in a new life where substances weren’t easily accessible and had a girlfriend who didn’t so drugs, so for a long time I just didn’t do drugs. It wasn’t a problem. Occasionally I’d still drink too much, but she wasn’t a fan of that and over the course of a few years I gradually got drinking under control until I ultimately just gave it up entirely. Even one beer now leaves me feeling this emotional hangover that I just hate. 

Things are going fine for a while, and we move to one of the states where weed is legal. The first summer we’re here, I get high a few times while she’s at work. I know she doesn’t want me to do this, and I feel guilty, but then she gets pregnant and I stop. 

Last Friday happened to be my day off. Before my wife leaves for work she says offhand that maybe on my upcoming vacation I could take a day to have an edible and deep clean the house. I thought that was a pretty cool thing for her to say, but didn’t think much beyond that. 

By 1pm I had taken two klonopin, gone to the weed store to buy a vape cartridge, came home, drank the only beer in the house (which had been sitting there for like two months since my mom left it here) and had gotten high. 

By 2 o’clock I had called my wife to tel her I have a substance abuse problem. 

It was like the mere suggestion that weed might be okay at some specific point in the future wormed it’s way into my brain in order to convince me that it would be fine to buy some today, just to have on hand, in case, and that I might as well try it, to know, and that as long as I stop smoking by whatever time I’ll be sober enough by the time she gets home that she’ll never know. 

The tricky thing, though, is that I don’t know what to call it. Am I an addict? I know this story certainly sounds that way, and I’m not trying to avoid the label, it’s that “addict” to me sounds more like people who, I don’t know, use more often? Whose lives are more disrupted? It feels like I would be claiming my problems are bigger than they are if I called myself an addict. 
But that day I felt out of control. 

I know no one can diagnose me without more context/details/some sort of license or something, but I’d love to hear people’s thoughts.

Does this qualify as addiction? Or am I just an asshole?",1614599735

My mother has been addicted to opioids and other medication for 13 years and I’m not sure how to help her,2,luwu6d,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/luwu6d/my_mother_has_been_addicted_to_opioids_and_other/,1,"After a near fatal car accident, my mother has been on prescription medication for the pain relief for over 10 years. Since then, she has became addicted. She still is prescribed them, however often takes more than she is supposed to at a given time. The primary medication which she abuses (and is prescribed) is:

- Lryica
- Zolpidem
- Cocodamol
- Amitriptyline
- Robaxin

There is other medication which she does not abuse. She often takes more than she is supposed to, leading her to be loopy, and it’s causing strain on my (and my fathers) relationship with her.  She can’t cut the pills out entirely as she is in dire pain for the majority of her day. 

We have tried to help her in every way we know how, including taking the tablets off her, putting them in a lock box and only giving them to her at certain times (when she’s supposed to take them) however she always finds a way around it (eg going to the store and buying OTC weaker stuff and taking lots of it). We can’t restrict her anymore without it becoming problematic because it would essentially mean not letting her go out. 

The most recent instance was today, when I found a weeks worth of zolpidem (a sleeping tablet) gone in the space of a day. Apart from the medical implications, it means she doesn’t have any left for when she needs them. 

My question is - how can we, as a family, support her to break the addiction and try to get back to some kind of normal?",1614592358

I am joining this group because it just feels like my recovery has hit a Plato and I'm hoping maybe joining a community like this and networking with everyone it will help me kick my recovery back into drive so I can continue to achieve many great things. I lost my mom a year ago and just seems like I gave up after she did. I'm still in the same exact boat I was in a year ago. Just as an ice breaker for me here's a question since you entered recovery what is one thing you achieved got back etc that you never ever in a million years thought you could. For me like I said recovery has given me the opportunity to refrain myself from using drugs in over 5 years. I'm not clean because I just stopped using its because I'm in recovery and it's a way of life. I hope to hear from everyone soon with theirs.

i used to do benzos every now and then in secondary school. thought they didnt rly do much tbh, was expecting an proper rush like opiods might

Then over last 3 years or so, ive used them quite alot, although only once or twice every few months or so (to help with some mental issues i was dealing with) 
Id binge, finally getting the rush i was after, but at the expense of becoming a blacked-out zombie, and terrifying those who care about me 


2 weeks ago:

I bought a 28 box of valium and did them all in 3 days, binging, blackout, blah blah blah you get the idea

But i realised benzos aren't a drug simply to get mashed on, merely jus to relieve some of the stresses of everyday life 


Yesterday:

I bought another box.
Plan is to do maybe one or two a day, not go overboard, jus to try be a bit more calm and sociable on a day to day basis, and hopefully get better sleep (so far has been quite pleasant)


i saw a quote ""addiction creeps up on you""
And im scared that it might be beginning to creep in

So just as an update, when I got to the rehab I had snuck fentanyl in with me and did it in the bathroom. Thankfully my roommate (who is a great friend I’ve had for 5 years) was awake at 3am and heard me making the death rattle in the bathroom. She found me on the floor, purple and not breathing. She was slapping me, yelling at me, and trying to do compressions. She ended up grabbing a tech who narcaned me twice and  thankfully my friend had already called 911 and the ambulance came and picked me up. I woke up to the thought, “I really fucked up this time” and I had never felt so cold in my entire life. The tech said 40 more seconds and I’d be dead. The paramedics took me back to the treatment center and for the next couple days I couldn’t shake the thought that I wish they hadn’t found me... I wish they would’ve just let me die. Now, two weeks later, I’m incredibly grateful. I’m happy to be alive. I can finally feel hope again. I can’t keep doing this to myself... and I know that if I do, my luck will eventually run out. I couldn’t imagine the pain my parents would have felt to hear that their daughter died on Valentine’s Day from an overdose. This time I will truly do everything in my power to stay sober.

Walking around with only one shoe on shows where I am mentally.,3,luneyi,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/luneyi/walking_around_with_only_one_shoe_on_shows_where/,2,"Sunday’s are my only day off. I look forward to this day all week as my job and my addictions put my body and mind through hell during the week. This morning I woke up around 6 am thanks to my body clock not understanding days off and a slowly creeping dope sickness. I got out of bed and tried to quietly go to the living room with the hopes of partaking in my drugs of choice before my wife and kids woke up. As I was pulling my stash from a hiding spot that was a bad choice in hindsight, I look up to see my wife standing there. She questioned me as to why I wasn’t sleeping in on my day off although she knew the answer. Like the drug sniffing dog that she is, she began the search of the area immediately surrounding me. At that moment I knew any hesitation on by me and she would be flushing my dope in a matter of seconds. I quickly grabbed the shoe that I had it hiding in and ran onto our back deck. To keep my dope and get well, I had to make a run for it. We live in a small mountain town and at the time of this decision it was a crisp 30 degrees. I was wearing gym shorts and a sweater. So I put on the one shoe that I had in my hand and jumped from our second story deck and ran for the closest place that I knew I could get high. I tried to ignore the fact that I was wearing only one shoe, pajamas, looking gaunt and sick like a dope fiend, and walking like I was being chased in a horror movie. I sat in a shitty make shift shed behind some dumpsters at a local hotel and did my drugs. I was shivering and my feet were killing me by then. Once the drugs began doing their job, I began to reflect on the scene that has just unfolded. My addiction has once again put my in a mindset that scares me. I want to break this cycle and be a normal functioning person, but it has its claws in me deep again......",1614567334
Worried that I have a dangerously addictive personality,1,luv7er,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/luv7er/worried_that_i_have_a_dangerously_addictive/,1,"I'm 22 and have to some extent been a high-functioning addict for 4-5 years. My first vice was alcohol, and I still get drunk about once a week but my drinking was definitely way worse in my late teens. Since then, I've mostly moved on to weed and I now smoke nearly every day. Throughout this time, I've also used various stimulants quite heavily, including adderall, vyvanse and cocaine which I used to do weeklong binges on, which has already given me chronic sinusitus. I also had a brief stint with oxycodone when I was 17 after being prescribed them after surgery, but (thankfully) my mom threw out the rest of my stash after seeing me overuse them.

In addition to substances, I also have other compulsive behaviours that might be problematic. I masturbate usually twice a day even though I don't even have a super high sex drive. I just feel like I always need some kind of ""high"" that I can chase, even if it's just a five second one I get when I cum, and once I start one particular habit or substance, it becomes part of my routine and something that my mind doesn't let me go without. I also use my substances to self-medicate, and getting super high or drunk is my top strategy for clearing my mind after a shitty or stressful day.

However, most people in my life don't know that I have these issues or this addictive personality as I live a fairly ""normal"" life in public. I'm about to graduate college and have a big 4 consulting job lined up, and I also recently started dating a very academic/career-oriented girl who goes to a top school and only drinks socially (no drugs at all). I'm worried that eventually, my compulsive habits will catch up with me and end up destroying my career or future relationships and friendships.

I feel like the second I quit one drug or compulsive habit, it just gets quickly replaced with another one and it's just an endless loop. Do you guys think I should ultimately go about this by trying to eliminate the need to get some kind of high? Or should I just acknowledge that I have this addictive personality and then channel that inner need to more benign habits (like just sticking with caffeine as an addy/vyv/coke substitute and using CBD products as a weed/booze substitute)?",1614587747

"After my junkie mother almost got me(18) killed, I moved out and called CPS for my younger siblings. A year later, everything is worse, and my siblings will be adopted out in 3 months.",16,lu9zgb,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lu9zgb/after_my_junkie_mother_almost_got_me18_killed_i/,7,"LONG POST

My mother has been an addict my whole life. I didn't know why I was under my dad's custody until I was a teenager and I had decided to move in with her. I really regret that choice, it ruined my life. She had been clean for 7 years, and through that time had 5 kids. They're my half siblings. The next oldest is 7 years younger than me, so they're all very small. 
My stepdad, her husband, is in the navy, so they moved often. 

A few months after I moved in, my mom ruptured 4 discs in her back, and was put on opiate pain killers. Within 3 months she was looking on Craigslist for black tar heroin. Back then I was 15/16 and she was bringing me along to her drug pickups. I became friends with her dealers, and looking back on it, was put in some really bad and potentially dangerous situations. She started giving me meth very quickly after she started using again. Just offering it to me when she had it. As a teenager, I was dumb and over the summer, she got me hooked pretty easily and convinced me to drop out of school to help her with all of the kids. 

Eventually she got pregnant with another baby while using. She continued to use heroin until 6 months into the pregnancy and she went and started methadone treatment. A week after my little sister was born and they were both discharged, she started on the street drugs again, but this time she started buying fentanyl. 

In August 2019 my mother gave me some of her meth, I believe it must've had some of her fentanyl in or on it, and after boofing my usual dose, I overdosed and was unconscious with minimal oxygen for 20+hours in my bed until anyone checked on me. My mom and stepdad took me to the hospital and I was put on life support for 3 days, I woke up with big sores on my face and hands, the doctor said they were 'pressure injuries' I'll be scarred and ashamed for the rest of my life for my stupidity.

After that I knew I needed to get away from my mom as soon as possible, and when CPS came to our house asking questions, she tried to blame EVERYTHING on me, even though I was a minor for most of the time this was happening. I was not in school, and she made sure I didn't leave the house, but to pick up drugs, more than once or twice a month. I left as soon as I could. 

I've been clean since I moved out with my boyfriend in October 2019, and I called CPS to protect my 6 younger siblings from being exposed to the same things that I was. It's been a year since I called and since then neither of my parents have followed the guidelines given to retain custody of their kids. 
In fact, my mother never checked herself into any kind of rehab, and instead ran off with her drug dealer boyfriend for several months, living in hotel rooms with him doing who knows what. 
She was arrested in January with her bf (whose list of charges is huge and terrifying). I don't see her much, but when I've messaged her she denies everything.

Here's the twist, my stepdad decided to bail her out of jail, against the wishes of CPS and everyone involved. And also decided to seal his fate by allowing her to move back into their military house, wreck both of their vehicles, and likely store drugs in the house. 

Now the Foster system will be adopting out all 6 of my brothers and sisters to their foster parents or other people in 3 months if no other solution is found. Their foster parents are mostly military and will be restationed, taking my siblings scattered across the country, where I'll likely lose contact. 
I don't know what to do at this point, there's no family willing to help, and as a 19 year old I don't make enough money to afford an apartment here in CA, Let alone care for 6 kids on my own. 

I'm very close with them and feel a huge sense of duty to keep this from happening. Especially since I cared for all of them alot when I was living there and my mom was too high/nodded out to do ANYTHING with them. I can't see them be split up, but I don't know what else I can do. 

ANY advice or 2cents is very very appreciated. Thank you for reading, if anyone actually read all of that rambling.",1614525942

Here's my dilemma, I love smoking at night, it helps relax me, takes away the aches and pains, and it enjoyable. However, I've abused Marijuana in the past and feel it will happen again. My usage has seeped into mid-day tokes and since I work from home and the urges about smoking midday, while working, are becoming real. I don't want to go down this path, I want to committ all the way, I know I should, but I can't. 

I appreciate you.",1614560882

For whatever reason she still considers me a friend and we keep I touch. She is one of the most amazing and beautiful people I’ve ever met and I really fucked up because it’s never ok to treat anyone like that and I still love her very much. I had anger issues even as a child and cannot blame drugs for my own shortcomings but they definitely played a major role in the ways I destroyed our relationship.

She got back with me after I threw away some drug paraphernalia in front of her and stuff but now won’t even talk to me because of something I did a week ago that I don’t even remember cause I was barred out.

He promised that he wouldn't play anymore and started investing, so now his gambling problem was redirected. Since then he lost money so many times and the family always helps (he pays back every time), he promises he will change, but things get rough for him and he hits a low spot and does it again.. recently he got a great job in a city that is about two hours from where we live, was also around the time he and his girlfriend broke up (were already living together) and during the middle of the pandemic. Therefore things changed dramatically, his job is really demanding and he is mostly alone, so no surprise he had a burnout (job related) and went back to the stock market, now he only have his car and is owing money to the bank. So here are some ideas, I want to know if you think is the best option: 
1) Tell him that he should get a job in our city and offer him to come live with us (his brother and me), so he would be able to save money and his brother can take care of his fiances
2) Their other brother wants him to quit and don't work for a bit, because he is really depressed, and go back living at their parents. I'm not sure it will be the best option because their mother is depressed and the parents are always fighting. I think it might make things worse. But at least is home for him.

Poly Drug and Tired,2,lu6cs7,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lu6cs7/poly_drug_and_tired/,15,"Hey all,

Long history with polydrug abuse peaking in 2010 with 4-methylmethcathinone and oxycodone, luckily got off with suboxone for 8 months and didn’t really feel the two week withdrawal. Off drugs from 2011-2016, slowly introduced back into oxycodone with doses rising as high as 300mg/day binges for 4 days before jumping on to kratom or suboxone.

Flash forward to 2021. I’m 34 and my poly drug radar is going haywire. I’m in the medical profession and am limited in my options but I seem to be doing everything possible to sabotage myself. I got off a 2mg/day Suboxone habit only to transition to a 2mg/day Clonazepam usage backed by spikes with 100-120mg/day methylphenidate binges leaving me depressed and phenibut run-ins with no self control. I have Lyrica and clonidine which I’m supposed to take to manage the symptoms but I can’t seem to stable out. If things look too boring, I’ll purposely fuck it up and justify using oxycodone when it comes around every month as a way to even out, but I gotta stop this immature behavior. I have a wife who was minimally supportive getting off suboxone and a beautiful 2 year old. Any advice is greatly appreciated that doesn’t involve tucking myself away in a rehab.

Things I'm learning and would.like to share,4,ltw4pt,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ltw4pt/things_im_learning_and_wouldlike_to_share/,3,"   I've been an addict for about 29 years.  Give or take a few prison terms. The things I'm learning about addiction,  myself, and how addicts are in general, and i would like to share with the Group, in hopes if touches someone else, like it did me.
   Addicts are looked at like selfish people, when infact we wear our hearts on our sleeves in some form or fashion. And we use to get away from those feelings. Doesn't have to be we care too much. It could be we hurt too much. But our addiction is an escape, we can at least all agree on that (am I right?) 
    I was just speaking to someone about how even  after I'm clean if I see someone from the old days of using and they need a favor, I'm quick to help. (I've been there) I know what it means to get even the slightest help when in a bad spot. But as this frien pointed out, now I've compromised myself, my hard work, infact I've compromised everything, and I need to 1st, think, and be slow to respond as I would usually. And 2nd, be as selfish about my recovery/sobriety as I was about my addiction. (Now I wasn't selfish per-sé, with my drugs) but I was quick with a lie or excuse when asked about it. I now need to apply that to the flip side of the coin, ""can you help me with blah,blah,blah?"" (LIE) ""sorry I'm in a rush, gotta do X,Y,Z right now."" Seems easy right ? But for an empath like me, it's a real challenge. But in the long run (And THAT is what we really need to look at)  it'll save me from a slip. ""Hey thx here's a (enter drug of choice)  for helping) or a** BLURP**  ""pull to the side of the road!"" And I'm back in, (bc I was being nice) but my record (which is ALL the court will see) says I was back at my antics. So in short, be selfish for your own sake, and think slower, to save your sobriety and freedom. You've been lied to by a fellow user, or dealer (yes you have) what's a lie to them, if it's to save your sobriety??",1614485078

I've been struggling with this for a long time, and in recent weeks it's become as bad as ever again. I'm addicted to food. Food makes me feel good. I like to eat a lot of food at one time, even after I become full, often to the point where I feel overstuffed and gross. Sometimes food is all I think about, even if I've already eaten plenty. I try to, and successfully lose most of the weight I put on but every few weeks or months I'll just go off the deep end and start binge eating again. It's like I lose all control and just give in to whatever cravings I have. For example, all week Monday-Thursday I ate pretty healthy foods. Just 2200 calories each day. But yesterday (Friday) I ate 4600 calories and today (Saturday) I ate 5900 calories. I try to make rules and stick to them but I just end up breaking them anytime I get slightly hungry. I always make up reasons why its okay for me to eat what I want, etc I'll eat nothing tomorrow, I'll exercise it off, It's a special occasion, shit like that. I really don't know how to stop and this has gone on far too long.

Like a slow bubble that got bigger by the day is how I can put into perspective her “help” “support”.    I have Arrived at the peak, climax of putting up with daily verbal abuse , it don’t stop . She reloads her gun like a video game when I think she has ran out of ammo she pulls out a new clip. My mom has been nothing but a let down,verbally been violating me as a human being. I guess it honestly hurt me to accept the harsh truth.  

Things have just been getting more heated around here, since my younger brother / best friend Dani Got taken away from us this august 29 at only 25 years old.. it has hit us hard each member of the family dealing with their own grief in their own way. My mom definitely got unstable and grew a bipolar disorder idk how to call her behavior I mean her and my sister 22 which has a special hate for me since I can remember. I’m 29. She began her hate towards me when I turnt 23 and she has not let up one bit. I picked up on substance abuse at 25.   I cannot make out 1 single moment of support or anything to help. , she don’t need to do anything for me as a fact, I mean it literally, so she chose me as her to go when she is needing to shake off some steam. And that’s every other day without an exaggeration that’s just how it goes here.   Mom verbally offers support but does the exact opposite in action. No one better to unmotivated me when I get a sudden “great idea”.  I use to think it was her way of protecting me from failure because she dint see me accomplished In anything I would share with her.  After about a year of her just shooting down my goals I began to see a pattern.  Not a single time do I recall her supporting a goal or just even saying I believe in you. Only one who genuinely had my back and was a real help And supportive was my lil bro Dani who is now in heaven. He’ must be so disappointed he know we’re better than this,   I have decided to check into a 30 day rehab more for the change of environment , I need some positivity, some hope , I guess I’m almost desperate for any one and any positive affirmation my way.. this streak of verbal daily abuse I mean just sad behavior coming from my moms my sister I’m used to her being sour and  evil, my mom has joined into same type of dark additude my sister radiates off.
I am desperately seeking to run far from this ,  I am ok in never coming back , Also I’m ok if I don’t ever speak to my mom   My sister i been cut the diálogo it’s a one way because she insist in talking to me
Even dou I’ve made it clear I don’t need or want to speak to her ever ,my days are slightly better when she keeps to herself.      Never did I see this coming, life been a bitch last 4-5 years I guess there’s somethings god can’t or just won’t make better, I still will hold on with a thigh grip to Hope for a better tomorrow.    People be nice to ur family members, let go of any grudges and tell them you love em as many times as you get a moment to do so.    Any advice or motivation moving forward would help me tremendously guys.  Thank you if you took the time to read this. I apologize if I come off as a cry baby..  I promise you guys I’ll never  / publish another post  unless I have something cool to share , or after rehab definitely some positive progress I’d like to share after I complete my time at facility maybe I won’t even want to leave LOL",1614471965

So still driving about back to Ohio I get a call no ones heard from my pops for a couple days... By time I made it home the police had already removed him. They said they found his just sitting and had a plate of what they assumed was coke next to him. I didnt make it that day before getting high. Then next day I over dosed inside my moms house wasnt breathing for 12 min paramedics were about to give up an i snap out. They take me to the hospital and I still had shit hidden. Second overdose. Nurses rush in an bring me back. Just for me to leave AMA to go cop again. The next 3days till the funeral I overdosed and died 5 more times. I had been doing opiates for almost 9 years without ever overdosing. Then die 8 times in leas that a week an a half. The funeral was to much for me I couldnt be around all thoae people saying sorry to me. Also at this point my whole familys convinced that it was a sucide and thats fuckin with me more. Next day I get a letter of the autopsy report. He had cocaine and fentanyl in his system then I knew what had really happend. No one does coke to try an overdose. That was 2 years ago durring that time quarentine happened now me and my gf are both doin fentanyl with being stuck in our apt getting 4k a month between both of us a month we both overdosed Multipul times. Thats when I made the decision to save everything we could and sold everything in our apt and bought a rv and drove it out here to cali kickin the whole way it was miserable. Then I got these tattoos on my hands saying FUCK FENT with my dads birthday and death date while getting it i made the promise to never touch that shit again and ive stuck with it. Also saved up 30k and was able to finance  in the process from trimming an moving some product. I doubt anyone will read this whole rant but for the ones who did im here to tell you that it is possible we are alot stronger than what we think. Over all in those last 2 years I overdosed more than 20 times I didnt care anymore I was ready to accept it. But everytime no matter what I always was able to be revived. Now I have a stable home money saved a great job im the industry out here and finally planning on having our first kid... I know what it feels like to hit the lowest of lows with no expectations of making it out. Sorry for how long this post was I tried condensing as much as I could. But I just hope someone does read my story and that it helps. Even if one person gets something out of this then great. I'll stop now lol but if anyone has questions or needs help please send a dm and I will do whatever I can to help get that monkey off your back.

I love all of you and you are worth it.",1614466042

They won't tell you they wish they could stop yet but I can see it in their eyes. Just above that mask that's been covering their face for so long. I have frank conversations with the kids and they'll tell you it's a problem.

In many cases, the parents already know and just allow it. How do I best help these kids and help change the culture of the school?

An example is best way to ask is my friend a problem gambler.

We will play poker regularly, but the game itself is not enough. He always wants to put in side bets, such as owing a few euro more to the person that knocks you out.
Or changing how much of the pot the winner gets ( we play 20 euro per rebuy and often second place will win 80per cent of the money, chips are just for the game).

He gambles online for more money than that, but would never go to a real life poker tournament.

He is also heavily involved in bitcoin and constantly pushing others to invest in it because 'it can only go up'.

He gets very frustrated if you don't go along, to the point where I won't play poker with my friends of he is playing, because of the aggressive response to me just wanting to play casually.

What do you think?

The Key to Long-Term Sobriety,3,ltdfp3,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ltdfp3/the_key_to_longterm_sobriety/,0,"  

## Long-term Sobriety

One of the many keys to the ever-changing lock of long-term sobriety is compartmentalization. The idea of compartmentalization is very simple however, this does not mean the application process is an easy one. The definition of compartmentalization is, ""the division of something into sections or categories.""(en.wikipedia.org) But, how does this relate to my sobriety? We've all heard the coined term ""one day at a time"", clear use of compartmentalization. Many, if not all of us, can not imagine our whole life without the use of drugs or alcohol. However, this is possible by using compartmentalization to break forever into one day at a time. Some addicts can go 24 hours without getting high or drunk, this is how they must break it down. For the addictions and alcoholics who cannot abstain from using or drinking for 24 hours must break this concept down into smaller pieces, I will not drink for 6 hours. There are those of us who cannot even imagine 6 hours and must be broken down even further, I will not drink for one hour. The true success of this method comes when you can realize you ONLY have to not drink for 24 hours. Sure, you can drink tomorrow but just not for the next 24 hours. The secret sauce, if you will, is that by the time that 24 hours ends you reroll the dice and a new 24 hours commences.

## Large Tasks

Though this concept seems simple and counterintuitive it has been proven again and again to work. Not only can you use this for sobriety you can use this for day-to-day hassles and mundane activities. Say I have to clean the entire house, an enormous and daunting task. Naturally, as addicts and people in general we will procrastinate and leave this task for the very end. The solution to this problem is apparent but not easy. You can make this daunting and intolerable task seem simple and easy through the use of compartmentalization. If you have 10 tasks to do start with one. Tell yourself, ""I will do one task and then I will be done."" By the time you are down with the first task, you have initiated that spark of motivation. If you don't trust me try it for yourself. About 80% of the time if I have a big task and I tell myself I will do one thing I end up completing the entire task. Completing that first task will give you the motivation you need to complete the subsequent tasks. This works incredibly similar to your sobriety. You develop a 'streak' of sobriety time and you've already completed one day, why not try to get another day. These days string together and before you know you're sitting there wondering how the hell you got a year.

A year,65,ls5gu5,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ls5gu5/a_year/,11,"Well it’s that time... just over a year ago i had my head buried in my hands as I received the unwanted ride to the hospital. I posted my relapse on Facebook and they pinged my phone to find my location. My friends thought my post was a suicide note. I’d like to say it wasn’t but I can see why they thought that. The police knocked on my car window less then an hour after making the post. I didn’t want to go with them. I just wanted to fade away. Ironically the Police Sgt that talked me into going was at my wedding about 20 years before.  I climbed in the back of the “escort” police car, and went on the long drive.  The longest ever. I just wanted to sleep. Sleep forever so I didn’t have to face anyone...I had done it again... I let everyone down. I’m a failure. 

It was ironic going to St Michael’s Hospital... walking in and recognizing a number of the people in the waiting room, as I had worked in the surrounding area for almost half my life. I thought everyone was looking at me. Laughing... “look at Jay hahaha”. They weren’t but that’s how I felt.  After all. I’m a failure. 

I was surprised at the visits I got.  A barista from the Starbucks I frequented, some coworkers, a couple police officers and a homeless guy I helped reunite with his family.  I figured everyone came to fill the gossip with other coworkers and friends. I thought I was so important that everyone was judging me. “What a loser... a failure”. 

After being released I went to my mothers. She gave the look of disappointment. I knew what I had done.   She took me in. Then it hit. Covid.  Nowhere to go anymore. 

The year has passed quickly.  It’s one I won’t forget... I never really knew how amazing my mother was   As the years went by, life went by... I would see her a few times a year as work or schedule always seemed to get in the way. I can honestly say if it wasn’t for her info not know where I would be... after all. I’m just a failure. 

Clean and sober, i got to spend some quality times with my kids... I miss the everyday interaction more than I can ever explain. It’s something we take for granted. Until it is gone.  They are growing up so fast. I’m happy I can see that. 

I grew closer to my eldest daughter. she had been my rock since my downward spiral  all began.  

So here I sit. So many to thank... the treatment Center I was at prior to my relapse - who gave me so many tools to help with my recovery. Including some friendships that will last my lifetime. To my family for giving me another chance. To the group I admin as well as the many I’m a part of who inspire me daily with their own battles.  Thank you to the ones who got me into treatment in the first place... the DM’s in my life.  Most of all. Thank you Mom. I’m a decent writer but when it comes to actual external emotions I struggle. Just know I love you even though I do not say it often. 

Although I’m not where I want to be mentally as I’m sure most of the world is during these trying times. I am getting a little better everyday....I can smile when I look in the mirror...because I’m not a failure. I’m a fucking warrior...

My current WIP has two characters who struggle with addiction. One of them has been addicted for a long time and the other is forced to take the drug over a period of time until he becomes addicted.

So many characters that are addicts are portrayed in a terrible light and I'm looking to break away from that as I firmly believe that addiction is an illness not a crime.

i feel like the majority of society doesnt realize how serious food addiction is,26,ls0mx9,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ls0mx9/i_feel_like_the_majority_of_society_doesnt/,7,"- usually acquired from a very young age, can be as young as 3 years old. for me it was around 6. this creates a dependency lasting for decades in the formative years. 

- eating is sometimes encouraged or induced by parents at an early age. example, my parents used food to show me they cared about me to try to fix the neglect. 

- food, especially junk food, is cheap, legal, and accessible. 

-  you have to continue eating food for the rest of your life to survive. you will be battling the thoughts at LEAST 3 times a day. forever. once you are over say, cocaine, you can separate yourself from those people, that scene, and live a clean life and not be constantly confronted with it. 

- the stigma of fat people just being lazy and slovenly is the general mindset. not that this person is struggling with a massively painful and deep rooted *addiction*. ""just stop eating so much!"". seems easy? i know this is a general misunderstanding about addiction. but alcoholics get sent to rehab people see them as sick and desperately needing help. fat people are more likely to be seen as just lazy, just go on a diet.


- body image. so many aspects of this. obesity can absolutely destroy your appearance. forever. multiple major surgeries are necessary just to get into a survivable state. and aside from that, beauty standards of being thin, having no rolls, smooth skin, are everywhere. companies use people's poor body image as a marketing scheme, crash diets and fad diets give food addicted people false hope. 


it is just as taxing as any other addiction. what i am learning is that anything can be addictive with enough mental conditioning. regardless of how chemically addictive it is. not to say food isnt chemically addictive, it is. these are just some thoughts i have been having. 


these are just the first points that come to my mind. i would love to hear what other people think about this.",1614265628

He stays up later and later (going to bed at 2:00am a few years ago - now it is 5:00-6:00am). Apparently the majority of what he does is read the news and post articles to facebook... When I visit, he frequently disappears to go sit at the computer instead of spending time with his family. There was a time when we would eat lunch together on my lunch break, but now he wakes up at 1:00pm, sometimes 2:00p, and that is no longer possible.

I am a 30 year old Male, with a decent life, some schooling under my belt and a decent career in printmaking. 


I have been abusing alcohol for nearly 9 years.
Abusing my adderall prescription for about the same amount of time. 

My addictions have caused me to drop out of school, cut relationships and lose multiple jobs. 

I am a musician and artist so the drugs and alcohol seem to come like a normal “mind alteration” 

But it has reached a point.

Although I’ve never gotten into trouble with the law. The drinking and adderall combination has caused me to pull some real stupid shit.
(Like steal clothing from a donation bin at 2 in the morning, or spend 50 dollars on porn steams at 4 AM.) 


I am now afraid the alcohol abuse and adderall
Usage is beginning to affect my cardiovascular health. My heart hurts at times, and I get numb in my fingertips. 


I have tried to reach out to my parents for help, maybe to send me to a rehab, but it all seems to cost too much. Is rehab really only for rich celebrities? How can I get clean? 

I am in need of help before my addictions give me heart failure or death.

Food addiction,1,ls4mdn,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ls4mdn/food_addiction/,10,"TL;DR: I have an uncontrollable urge to eat and I want to lead a healthy life. Please suggest ways out of it( I can't afford therapy).

Hi,
I'm a long time reddit user but this is a burner acc, im not a bot. English isn't my first language so pardon me if there are any grammatical errors. 
Also on mobile, so the formatting might be off. I've been visiting this sub on my main for a while(never joined because I don't want people to find out.)

Im almost 20 and weigh over 160kgs(over 350 pounds). I love food. So much so that I dont stop eating until my stomach hurts and sometimes i feel an urge to eat even when my stomach hurts. I loved eating for as long as I can remember. The problem just got worse during the pandemic. I had to come home(parent's house) and with everything being online, I stay here. Both my parents are working and I stay alone at home all day. 
They are obviously worried about my health and pressure me to go on a diet and exercise a bit. I know that they are just concerned about my health and wanna help me. And I agree. I've joined a gym but I dont go because it's very embarrassing for me and people stare at me when i exercise and give advice that i never asked for. I technically am on a diet(as far as my parents know). But as soon as they both leave for work, I start to feel an uncontrollable urge to order food and just go to town. The sad part is I dont even enjoy eating food anymore, but I still order, eat and then the worst part, I go out and throw the packaging and stuff somewhere in a dump so my parents don't know I ate that much. With me being a 20 year old college kid with no job, I obviously have trouble finding money for food( my mom makes delicious food, we're not poor. My mom just makes it for 1 person. I feel like i eat for 3 people). So i steal money from my own parents. I am tearing up as I write this. I STEAL MONEY FROM MY OWN PARENTS FOR FOOD THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EAT. These realizations hit me atleast once a day and I vow to stop ordering food, i delete all the food ordering apps. But then after I while I lose all that motivation and I order food. Before it was just secret extra lunches. I feel like I hit a new low recently. My dad's 52 and my mom's almost 50. So they sleep by 10 pm. I stay awake till about 1 or 2 am atleast because I have work to do. Ive started secretly ordering food at night after they sleep and silently eating it in my room. I store the packaging in my bag till the next morning and throw it out secretly.  The other day, i was eating at night and started tearing up in between the meal. But i still finished it so that no one finds about it.

I feel so shitty and I do want to change but Ive been very unsuccessful. I am not tooting my own horn, but I am generally a  smart kid. I topped classes with minimal effort. I understand computer science concepts relatively easier than a lot of people and so on. But my grades have been tanking recently(recently as in college. So thats 2 and a half years. I balooned after i went to college. I had no one to help me control my intake and I ate as if everyday was my last). The reason I feel is .. food. I eat a lot, I feel sleepy and lose time studying. 

I really really do wanna change. As ive said I don't enjoy eating that much food anymore. Ig after so much eating, im just tired of it. Please someone suggest me ways out of this hellhole. I really do want to lead a healthy and happy life. I've tried herbal life. It worked for a while and then as with everything i lost motivation and started cheating again. I want to be that smart kid again. And i don't want to lie to my parents or anyone anymore. I can't afford therapy by myself and I doubt my parents are going to agree(mental health is still not accepted as a real thing where I live).


Edit: I forgot to add that I sometimes I just give vague reasons and my dad always trusts me and gives me money. Most of the time i just say Im buying a course online and I need money. He always gives me more money than I ask for just in case I need it. I DONT EVER WANT TO BREAK THAT TRUST.  And if I decide to come out with all this to my parents, I feel that first Id lose their trust, and they'd worry a lot more than they are now and I don't want them to worry when they're 50 years old.",1614281752

Help figuring out what someone may be on,8,lrrbfz,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lrrbfz/help_figuring_out_what_someone_may_be_on/,14,"Someone close to me has been struggling with heroin addiction for the past 15-20ish years, with some other things mixed in occasionally. He’s been clean for (I think) a couple of years now and doing surprisingly well, but the past two weeks it seems like he’s fell off the wagon again. But this time it doesn’t seem like heroin, he isn’t acting how he normally would when he has relapsed in the past. Maybe it just looks different this time but I’m not sure. So I’m
hoping by describing some of his actions, I may get some help figuring out what he’s been on the last two weeks. 

His birthday was Feb 13th, so last Saturday, and he went to Florida to golf and vacation or whatever. Apparently he’s been acting like this since before then, claims him and his uncle went out to dinner before Florida and his uncle got sick and now he’s “sick” as well but hasn’t taken a shit in going on 5 days. He skipped the birthday dinner we had planned for him this past Sunday saying he had the shits...but again, hasn’t shit in 5 days. His family owns a company that he works for and he hasn’t been to work in 3 days. I’ve been checking in on him, telling him he needs to go to urgent care, etc and he’s just been complaining about how bad his stomach hurts and how he can’t shit and can hardly pee. Went to urgent care and they said they couldn’t hear any bowel sounds and told him to go to a hospital but I’m sure he won’t. He’s been taking laxatives daily and it’s doing nothing. His manager said something to him about not showing up and he proceeded to send me multiple texts bitching about how all his coworkers are cunts and blah blah blah. He’s just being really extreme and irrational, everything he says makes no sense.

He’s been on probation since July 2019 and is supposed to be off July of this year and gets tested regularly and hasn’t failed so I’m assuming it isn’t an opiate but I don’t know what else blocks someone up that badly? I was thinking maybe fentanyl but I’m not seeing anything about constipation being a side effect of that online.

Problem with adderall,3,lrls42,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lrls42/problem_with_adderall/,12,"    Hello everyone, I’ve decided to make a post because I’m not entirely sure what else to do. I’m 20 and For the past 4-5 years I’ve gone through mainly Dexedrine (along with any other stimulants I can get) binges that last from about a week to a month, using 100-300 mg of Dexedrine XR (sometimes crushed and pressed) each day of those binges. These episodes of abuse usually happen every 1-3 months, or whenever whenever I can obtain them. I know this is a problem and I need to know how to stop, stimulants have always been my go to and the one of the only things that make me feel actually happy/confident in life. I want to figure out how to live life without having to be stimulated, how to talk to people and play video games with friends without having to be under the influence. When I’m not high on Dexedrine, Vyvanse, adderall, or Ritalin, I feel like life is pointless. I can’t even get out of bed or hop on the pc to play a game with some buddies because I feel like I’m not being the best version of me. Without stimulants I feel like a waste of a person, not able to contribute anything, be it video games or conversations. How am I suppose to deal with life while not stimulated? Is it possible to achieve the same effects and focus naturally? The same confidence? I’m not really sure if I worded this correctly and please feel free to ask anything you’d like about my personal life, I do not often talk about my personal problems, especially the ones involving drugs. Any personal experiences, or remedies you found that helped you live without stimulants are appreciated. Thank you for any help.",1614225213

Caffeine Addiction,1,lrp3c1,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lrp3c1/caffeine_addiction/,4,"~ sorry for the length I got a little wordy :,)) 


Now it’s cliche to say, but i know this is no where near as serious as the other addictions on this subreddit but i’m afraid i’m not really sure where else to ask and your guys’ advice can be helpful. 

Currently, probably since around July 2020, i have had an addiction to drinking monster energy drinks. I know it sounds silly but there is something to them, my mom (I’m in highschool as a frame of reference) doesn’t allow me to drink them so there is some sort of adrenaline to going to the gas station and getting them, knowing I can’t get caught, along with the obvious caffeine and fake sweeteners (I only drink the low cal ones) . I drink close to one a day, today I drank two, and although it doesn’t sound like a lot I realize that for a 16 year old girl that much caffeine (as well as who knows what other chemicals) can not be healthy. 
        I can barely go more than a day without one, because as i’m driving i’ll just start craving to buy another one, and of course i give in. I quit drinking them for a couple weeks in january as I had covid and couldn’t get any, and I felt miserable the whole time. I was cranky, uncomfortable, and sleepy alll theeee timeee. And while being at home like that isn’t bad, when I get to school and start to feel the first period drowsiness start to kick in I just give in and go get another monster. 
      I also suffer from a bad heart, so I know in the long term drinking caffeine will only make that worse. And as I am on my own come august I want to start making the best possible decisions for my future, this being one of them. 
      I’ve tried talking to my friends about trying to quit for the sake of my health, and it seems they are rather apathetic to my cause. Like for example if I say “oh i’m trying to quit i don’t want one” they will just buy me one with their money instead. 
     And once again, I realize this is nowhere near as bad as some of these other addictions, but the impulses are real and I know if I don’t step in now I will just continue to drink them. 
    It also puts a huge strain on my bank account, as they are nearly 3 dollars a pop and I barely have any money to my name. So if not for my health, then I must quit for the sake of my bank account. 


tldr; I know I have an issue with energy drinks and I want to stop before it turns into irreversible damage and or leads to future addictions so all advice on how to quit would be appreciated much love ~

Anyone else?,2,lrjcy3,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lrjcy3/anyone_else/,2,"Unfortunately I brought it on myself.  I thought I’d beaten it, I didn’t drink from March last year and was aware of the quantity of codeine I was taking and when I thought it was creeping up. I reduced.

I’ve lived in this house which was my parents for 40 years.  My dad died from cancer here, my mum collapsed and died in front of me too, both over Christmas periods.  In between I escaped an abusive marriage, got diagnosed with epilepsy, was made officially homeless for a while and many other things I’m not proud of.  My brain couldn’t cope, my only thing I had left was the children.

We were doing ok, I took them abroad, day trips, short holidays.

I sold the house but I struggled to progress that because I can’t talk on the phone I just can’t due to anxiety, so it took longer than it should.  Focusing on that I ignored the social services meetings I should have attended, due to CoVid the children had time off school and due to depression my daughter missed appointments.

But the social worker would visit weekly, I’d make sure it was clean and tidy and try to tell her things even though I didn’t trust her.  She didn’t tell me once anything was wrong.  They dropped the PLO process that threatened the children being taken saying I’d progressed enough to drop that. 

We were looking forward to a brand new start, in a brand new, much smaller manageable house in the country.  I had offer accepted and nothing was said.

January 3rd the anniversary of my mums death social worker came.  She told me it had been decided I hadn’t done enough and they were taking me to court to remove the children.  The next day the house sale etc fell through.  I spiraled, I managed a few days clean but couldn’t eat, sleep, I just sat on the sofa wallowing and not understanding how this happened, I felt they planned it, they must have we were 2/3 weeks ago from starting a complete new start and it was gone.

One night after a bottle of wine earlier in the day I sneaked to the shop to get another, I got stopped, drink driving, arrested.  Children were taken the next day. I couldn’t understand why they let me plan a new life, but a house, arrange schools, and then right before literally telling me I can’t it’s cruel at best.

Two days later was first suicide attempt, hospital for a few days I was scared to come home.  Then I caught CoVid. Codeine came out again.  Started drinking daily, until the weekend I hit rock bottom, paranoia, palpitations, vomiting blood, thought that’s it I’m screwed.  Had conversations with Donald trump and the queen sitting in my bed, had flashbacks of my life, pretty sure I had seizures.  Begged to just die.

Zoom call with children last week I was drunk and they knew, this weeks cancelled.

It’s not a pity party I’m creating here.  I think I’m over the worst, I pray I am, I’ve been drinking water easily and been able to eat, house is a shit hole but that can wait.  Once your heads clear guilt sets in, worry for the future, worry my children hate me but I have to get passed that.

I’m planning on continuing selling this house and I’ll rent for a while, I’m thinking about volunteering or training , my children are safe, so time to work on me.  I don’t know if I will but I need to try.

I’m going to get a kitten as a distraction I think. I need to implement routine in my life, I need to get out this house, too many memories and you always remember the bad ones.

I feel ok today, I did have to take just two tablets this morning because my legs were crazy but I didn’t take any yesterday and haven’t drank so I’m praying they don’t set me back, I also only took 8mg ones.  I  think I might have cracked it again but this time I need to keep it up.

I’m in trouble I know because the court’s ordered a hair strand test which will show some alcohol but loads codeine I’ve been trying to avoid it but I can’t anymore.

I think it’s time to admit everything and pray after a period of proving myself I’m given a second chance.

Anyone ever lose their children this way?  Did you get them back?  I’d love some hope.",1614219093

Trying,2,lri5pa,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lri5pa/trying/,0,"Spent the last 5 days in withdrawals but I think I’ve done it 

I’ve struggled since losing my mum two years ago.  Periods of good, bad and bearable.  Social services got involved last year after either the drinking, codeine or both knackered kidneys, I lost my children for a while but got them back and was doing ok until the anniversary of mums death at Christmas .  It started with the occasional wine, then bottle, 2, 3, then I got caught drink driving at night after sneaking to buy more.  Now I’ve lost the children aswell.  Two suicide attempts later at the weekend I think I hit my rock bottom for the first time.  I’ve battled for days to clean my system, I’m amazed I’m alive, but I am, and I need to retrain my brain and that’s what you have to do too.

You will lose your daughter and then everyday becomes a battle not to just not drink but becomes a battle to want to live.

Today I’m not too bad I’m tired because I haven’t slept for days but I still can’t, but the physical symptoms fingers crossed are now bearable.

Add me as a friend and maybe we can help each other.

I don’t know if I’ll get my children back, it terrifies me but I’ve finally realized i shouldn’t think that way, because that’s my selfishness I should be thinking they are safe, they may be sad but they are safe.

I have no family left,  none, no friends, people say you must have someone but truth is I don’t, I even gave my dog up.  So this battle I have to face alone, but I have to, I have to accept what I’ve done and stop making the excuse of my mum dying in front of me, I need to put my children first, I won’t get them back anytime soon if at all, but I haven’t lost them forever, as they grow the decision is theirs and so I need to work on me in the meantime fans start to prove I can change.

Em said she has tried everything to get rid of this addiction, she's even resulted to eating ice cubes to try and distract herself from the urge to take the pain killers. 
I asked her if she had tried getting addicted to something less dangerous like food but that didn't end up working either. 

If Em continues to go down this path of taking the Tylenol, she could do serious damage to herself. I cannot do too much because we don't live in the same country and I can only suggest what she can do.

My boyfriend, his brother and I all live together. Since the beginning of quarantine we have all been spiraling into addiction. First it started with nicotine and then eventually coke (we were all previous users). The coke began just as a special occasion to go to a party. And then over a few months my bf and his brother started to bring it home more often. I’m no angel either. I would get upset with them for bringing it home but would end up doing a little anyway after they said they weren’t throwing it away. But the switch flipped for me after my boyfriend had a terrible comedown experience and thought he was going to have a heart attack. I had never been so scared. After that we all said we weren’t going to mess with this shit anymore. Since then (1-2 months ago) I have stayed far away from it. But they have still been getting it behind my back. While I’m sleeping, at work, etc. It not only upsets me to be lied to and for them to think I won’t notice but every single time I confront them they tell me it won’t happen again and still they keep doing it. The last it happened I had a heart to heart with my bf and said if he doesn’t stop lying to me/ doing coke behind my back I’ll have to send him to rehab, tell his parents, or just straight up take a break from this relationship. After that conversation I thought he had realized I can’t take this revolving door anymore. Only 3 days after that I got home from a double shift tonight to find that yet again they brought home coke. For no reason, on a random Tuesday l, just because.

How do I handle a stuck brother halfway in recovery and tired parents ?,2,lr4jnm,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lr4jnm/how_do_i_handle_a_stuck_brother_halfway_in/,7,"Im on my phone so please excuse mistakes. 

A little background info. I (33F) have a brother (37M). My parents divorced, which wasn’t pretty, when I was 13 and bro was 17.  My bro was close w my mom during his high school years, got decent grades, played basketball and never caused problems. He was the golden child  (this is important later) and could do no wrong bc he just did what my mom told him to. He got a partial scholarship to college and went 4-5 hours away. We were not close before (he was that “mean big brother type”). 


From what my mom has told me, I’ve always been very independent and self reliant from a young age.  This never changed. Combined w this unaddressed anger about the divorce, my teenage stupidity and her misdirected need to control me, we did not live well together. Long story short, I was kicked out of my house at 17. I went to community college and worked full time to support myself. We reconciled after a few years and realized we have diff points of view on things and agree to disagree which is ok. I love my mom endlessly. 

That brings me to my problem w my brother. During sept 2016, he asked for a family meeting and told us his situation. He was addicted to opioids.  Even though he was making $300k a year plus commission, he hadnt paid his mortgage or any bills in over a year and the $65k he had borrowed from my mom (which I was not aware of) was for drugs. He moved into my moms house and basically shut down. We handled his condo sale and moving his belongings, looked into rehab or in/out patient centers. He said he could do it himself and has been successful/unsuccessful at times.

After a lot of literal blood, sweat and tears, I own my own company and doing ok for myself. After being labeled the bad kid who was a let down, I’m proud. Now that my bro is home, my mom has been leaning on my emotionally and psychologically a lot but in the last 3 years it’s been overwhelming. Her perfect child is mow her biggest stressor and she can’t fix him. Between started my own business, my family, Covid and life in general, I’m exhausted in every way possible but grateful I’m still working and providing for myself and employees. 


My mom has provided every ave of help that a person in recovery could ask for but he consistently has user habits, lies and won’t get a job. It is wrecking her. She’s aged 15 years in just 6. 

I’ve given the suggestion of giving him a timelines of when he needs to move out so my mom can spend her retirement in Florida as she had planned before he moved home but she refuses. She says she can’t leave him without knowing he’ll be ok. I’m a little resentful she was able to kick me out so young but that’s not the main issue. 


My bro has a history of stealing money. There’s never been direct evidence but both mom and dad had cash missing within days of my bro being there. The last time my mom found out he stole cash she was barely phased. It broke my heart. Well today he stole from me with hard proof. I called him to confront him and he said he had just forgotten to give me money which was obvious bullshit. He said he’d pay me that night but didn’t.

Idk how to handle this. I love my bro and know addiction is not easy but he’s done nothing to help get his life together. He’s continually making bad decisions and my mom is a diff person due to the stress and upset. 

I just need some advice as to how to help my family please. I feel like I’ve tried everything and need some outside advise.",1614172695
Was I really an addict if it wasn’t that hard to stop?,3,lr0j24,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lr0j24/was_i_really_an_addict_if_it_wasnt_that_hard_to/,5,"When my state was initially locked down for covid I took leave from my job. I had been a frequent coke user in my senior year of high school when I did it multiple times a week for a period of 6 months and then I stopped for a while. Then in 2019-2020 I was using semi regularly with a close friend, every 2-3 weeks I think and I would have used a lot more but they didn’t want use as often as I did and at the time I didn’t want to use alone. It has always been my drug of choice. But when I took leave I began doing it by myself almost everyday. I stole money and lied to my family, which I am so ashamed of. I did stuff I would not have done normally(meet up with strangers for sex spontaneously and sharing very personal information with these people that I didn’t know). I’m bipolar and have bpd and I think doing coke every night made my symptoms a lot worse. I actually think that I ODed once but I didn’t go to the hospital I just hoped for the best and needed up being alright. I lost a lot of weight. I know those are classic signs of addiction. I stayed on my leave longer than I should have because I didn’t want to stop. Eventually though I had to go back to work and I just stopped doing it. It was kind of difficult mentally but I stopped using without going to rehab and to this day nobody knows that I had this issue. I feel so much shame about this part of my life. I just want someone else’s opinion on whether I was actually an addict or if I was just someone who did the drug a lot and then stopped.

They just kept breaking the ""I'll never do [x] for drugs"" promise we all make to ourselves. We just keep pushing that line. I'll never take out a cash advance for drugs. Until I did. I'll never take a payday loan for drugs. Until I did. I'll never ""borrow"" money from my 401k for drugs. Until I did. I'll never straight-up clear out my retirement account for drugs. Until I did. I'll never take money from my child's savings account.  You guessed it. Until I absolutely did.

And it keeps going. And eventually, you're no longer in control. You're driving across town, tears streaming down your face while you scream at yourself to stop, turn around and get help. But you won't. You'll keep driving, meet the plug to trade more cash that isn't yours for a substance that will ultimately lead to you either incarcerated, institutionalized, or dead.

This sneaky disease is telling someone who is reading these words: ""That's not you, don't worry"". It's telling you it won't be you, that you're in control, that only weak-willed pathetic people who have no sense of when things are getting bad will get themselves into this trouble.

Battling an addiction before it truly starts,2,lqpqje,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lqpqje/battling_an_addiction_before_it_truly_starts/,4,"TRIGGER WARNING: This post talks about an experience with addiction. 

Hi everyone, 

I really need to get something off of my chest. First, I think I should share my background a little bit. 

I started smoking cigarettes when I was 15. For what? Idk. I was always drawn to being a “rebel”. Then I drank for the first time, and the same night at a drama production after party tried cannabis. Throughout my high school years I truly made a fool of myself at parties and with friends while drinking. Also getting the most “fucked up”, blacking out and getting very sick. 

Cannabis was something that I would do maybe once bi-weekly. It then progressed by the time I was 17 to smoking every night before bed. I would sneak out of my house when my parents were sleeping to smoke a joint or out of a homemade pipe. 

At my prom after my high school graduation I tried MDMA for the first time. And that’s when I would say my true fascination for drugs developed. That summer I would do it at least once weekly. 

Then, that same summer (still 17 years old) I tried cocaine for the first time with my friends. We walked around outside for at least 6 hours continuously taking lines. By the end of the night I was strung out and extremely speedy, couldn’t sleep for at least 4 hours after I took my last dose. 

Fast forward to today. I am 23 years old. From the ages of 18-21 I would say I definitely used drugs (alcohol, cannabis, mdma and cocaine) to cope. Every weekend was filled with use of at least one of those, but usually a cocktail. I was also using cannabis daily. If I was not at school or work I would be high. I thought it was a lifestyle. Then my mental health deteriorated. 

From the ages of 21-22 I was truly doing very well. I distanced myself from the friends I was doing drugs with and focusing on myself and building healthy relationships with healthy people. I was happy. I was clear headed. I was proud of myself. Then, one of our friends died and I started rekindling with those old “bad influences”. 

Every time I’d hang out with them, there would be cocaine there. I would dabble with it and think nothing of it. Fast forward to now and I am doing cocaine at least 3-4 times a week, and I have impulses to buy it and not think much about it. I haven’t really told my good friends that are good influences because I am ashamed of myself. I know it was my choice to hang around them and partake in it. I know it was my choice to continuously see them. But now I am at a point where I crave cocaine. I don’t want to be this way. 

Anyone else have any similar experience or can give me some advice? And thank you for taking the time to read this behemoth post.",1614134758

I'm in an APG which i don't know if you guys know what that is. Basically a teen sober group that helps drug addict kids get sober. Crazy Right? In AA meetings I always hear "" When I was your age I wish I got sober so i didn't fuck all of my family up and lose people"" I have lost people to overdoses, drug deals gone bad. I don't know why I am saying that. In the past three months shit has gone south. The person I was living with in spite of my 6 months sober, my program helped me live with someone ""hosting"" as they call it in the apg. Well I fucked that shit up, stole from my good friends mom kpins, codine, adderall vyvanse. A bunch of shit. Got tramadol too. That was the beginning. Then I moved home from ""hosting"" continuing to go to AA meetings fucked up, show up at my APG high, and was lying to my family. This is where shit went south. I bought from a dealer who used to be a friend of mine. A day later she overdosed on xannax. My friend in the APG who i've known for 4 years out of highschool was best friends with this girl. I have to make a living ammends for that. Coke and Oxy's, was it worth it? fuck no. Then I proceeded to prostitue myself for nudes to try and get meth and meetup with people who did meth and had heroin. I found a guy who was going to have sex with me for meth Luckily he gave me his dealer so I didn't have to do that. Also I had sex with a man for some alcohol who was 31.. I am 18. Anyway yeah shit went really south. Speedballed for weeks, my job knew something was up. Stopped the meth, was buying a gram of fentnyl laced heroin every chance i could get, twice a week I don't even know if that's a lot. I've had nobody to talk to about this shit. Welp the fent made me paranoid, threatened to kill someone in a whataburger because I thought I was getting jumped. Was going to overdose, had a knife to my throat. Then I called my sponsor who i'd been lying too for months. He's taking me into his home and holy fuck im so grateful. I have been crying to my friends who somehow are still there for me. I fucked up my family, 4 rehabs 2 years in recovery overdose at 13 I live in the subburbs what the fuck is wrong with me. Besides suffering from childhood abuse but dosen't everyone have that shit??? Anyway I hurt people time and time again. If I gotta be homeless in downtown houston after I can't live with my sponsor anymore I'm probably going to do that. I WANT BEING SOBER TO BE THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT. Don't know where I got that but this is defnitley a bottom. parents kicked me out and I don't know what's gonna happen next. Quit my job because I found out I gotta go live in downtown 2nd ward with my sponsor. I need to get this shit on lockdown because if I fuck it up. I am dead haha.

Addicted brother wreaks havoc on entire family - help.,1,lqnl7h,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lqnl7h/addicted_brother_wreaks_havoc_on_entire_family/,8,"I am really struggling with the impact that my brother's (36M) opiate addiction is having on my family. I (32F) live with both of my parents who are 70+ and act as their caretaker, as well as work full time from home for the time being. This has been my living situation for the last 6 years and it works out very well for my parents and I. I am really close to my mom and my dad and spend a lot of time with them. However, 3 years ago, my brother was convicted of several felonies for possession/intent to distribute. He served a short jail sentence, the charges eventually were dropped, and he immediately returned home to live with my parents. Shortly after, he wrecked his car (which I believe was 100% on purpose to get pain killers) and went to court to sue over supposed back pain issues that resulted from the car accident. This process took 3 years, during those 3 years he has not had a job and lived solely off of my parents. After receiving a sum of money after the car accident court case, my dad ""manages"" his money, but my brother takes complete advantage over him. Every few months he goes through a week-long withdrawal from god knows what. Even so, his doctor continues to prescribe him opiates even though the same doctor sent him through rehab and has helped him during several different withdrawals over the years. 

With all of that being said, I am having an INCREDIBLY difficult time because I can see things that my parents choose not to see. For example, my parents are going out of town tomorrow for the first time alone in 20 years, but my brother chose to use this time to tell my dad to give him hundreds of dollars ""just in case something happens when they are gone"" and unless my dad gives it to him he will simply bother my father NON-STOP til he gives in. Last week he went out to a bar and brought a random stranger home (we have all been very strict about COVID), proving again that he just truly doesn't give a fuck about anyone except himself and his drugs. Now it's causing severe tension with what was once a very good relationship I had with my parents. 

Do I have to cut my parents off until they cut him off?? It feels like my only option because I can't live like this and watch my parents be treated like this, but then I would be abandoning my parents when they need help, despite them enabling my brother. If I put up with the way things are running then I too an am enabler, so how do I keep a relationship with my parents and not the human leech living on them?

He is supposed to move out by March 1, but I doubt that will actually happen as he is blowing through all of his money on bars and drugs so far, despite my dad ""handling"" his money. Gosh there is just so much to the full story but this was the best synopsis I could think of. I feel like he controls all of us and we are trapped. I used to have more sympathy and compassion for his addiction, but it's taken every last ounce of energy I have. 

I don't know what I am looking for in writing this out but if anyone takes the time to read this and has any advice to offer, please let me know.

What Are The Main Differences Between Addiction And Dependency?,0,lqn6w5,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lqn6w5/what_are_the_main_differences_between_addiction/,3," 

Addiction, and Dependency, are quite different.

Dependency, means someone heavily depends on it in order to have a pleasant or enjoyable time.

Addiction, however, means they feel such unpleasant withdrawal effects, that it greatly defects the quality of their life, and are highly likely to steal, or lie, to support their habits alone. 

Someone who steals to support their habit, and fucks over other people, without caring, or giving a shit, the effects it has on others, is highly likely to be hated and disrespected, and solely for their drug habits. 

In 2015, I was addicted to Cannabis. I stole to support my habit. 

I supported a smoking partner and his girlfriend willingly, not even acknowledging the day I would be caught, and I did on the Friday Morning of June 26, 2015. I was 19-years-old.

In the past year, since covid lockdown, I ran out of money, every, single, month.

Since I have been laid-off due to the global pandemic, and apart from disability pay, have no source of income. 

The past 9 months especially were beyond unpleasant for me to deal with. It was mild for family to get annoyed with hearing me sulk or complaining of being broke/having no money and especially nothing/fuck all to do around here, apart from smoking or drinking. 

Yesterday I crossed the line, and decided perhaps uttering countless malicious and brutal death threats towards family (middle sibling and father) for no reason whatsoever other than attention would provide relief, and it sure did. 

Making violent threats that I am going to kill someone, and inflicting fear towards the other person, gave me an extraordinary pleasant sense of power, dominance, and adrenalin. 

Getting the attention of uttering terrible death threats, gave me a sense of psychological relief, and I never, would have done that, if I just had some weed to smoke, OR some alcohol to drink. 

I had absolutely neither of either or, because I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY. 

I ran out of money in the middle of the month, every single month, and can’t buy either weed nor beer, and for the 9th goddamn month in a row. It was then, I flew off the handle and decided to utter death threats toward my older brother of 18 months, along with our father. 

I still have neither (cannabis or alcohol) and the last purchase was a gram on Saturday.

Until my money is in, the next 3 days are going to be brutal and disturbing UNTIL I can either more weed to smoke OR have more beer to drink. 

Being broke (having no money), especially when where in a covid lockdown, with literally fuck all to do, causes extremely unpleasant, psychiatric distortion. 

Obviously It doesn’t EXCUSE threatening to kill my father along with my middle brother, but it sure as hell EXPLAINS it. 

Being in my very unfortunate financial situation would make anyone, totally insane, it’s not just me.  ",1614128409

A few weeks ago I had a discussion with a friend about a story of a friend of ours who claimed that she had had a relationship of over a year with someone who was addicted during the relationship. The relationship ended after the guy ghosted her. Years later he confessed to her that he was a drug addict (hard drugs) during that relationship.

I was thinking about it:

1. is it even possible that you have a relationship that long and being able to hide a full blown drug addiction (not even occassional use, but a real drug addiction). I mean, even in cases of a long distance relationship you should notice that someone is not always behaving normal. I get it addicts may lie about something.

**- Not giving up.**

You know when a toddler is learning to walk? Step, step, fall. Step, fall. Step step step.... fall. Do they give up? NO. They are learning a new thing. They are going to fall. They just sit for minute and pick themselves right back up. That's how we need to be as adults. Don't dwell on the fall. GET. BACK. UP. And with practice, we will all learn to walk.

**- Re-label myself.**

""I am not a person that \[does XYZ\]."" Re-labeling myself in this way prevents the questioning in my brain of, ""Should I?"" Because the answer is: I am not a person that does this. I am not a gambler. Self-identifying in a different way really helps.

**- New friends.**

I have had to distance myself from friends that like to gamble. I'm sure I don't need to explain why. I've been focused on developing friendships with people that have other, more positive hobbies.

**- Remove the need for willpower.**

Blocking myself from danger sites online is helpful because then I don't need to waste willpower on resisting. When an option is removed, you can't do it. You don't have to expend energy resisting it.  Next step is I want to remove my credit card info from my computer so that it doesn't auto-fill anywhere. Apparently we all have only so much willpower, and if you can conserve it and save it for when you actually need it, great. Don't waste it when you can instead just block yourself from things/people/places.

**- Not doing it alone.**

I was listening to a podcast (Alex Wood Quits Everything) and he said: addicts can quit however they want but they shouldn't do it on their own. Support is KEY. And I have to agree. I made it three months by myself. Seven months with a sponsor. And now I'm at 41 days and I'm seeking help everywhere I can. I know the difference it can make.

**- ""Play the tape"".**

This expression refers to old VCR video cassette tapes. It essentially means, ""play the video"". As in, you KNOW what's going to happen. Play it in your mind. See how it turns out. Giving in to your addiction, will it be fine for a minute? NO. Play the tape. You see how this ends. You've been there. So you play it out in your mind instead of living it time and time again. Play the tape. And then walk away from whatever it is you were tempted by.

**- H.A.L.T.**

Hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Are you any of these things? Giving in to your addiction is not going to feed any of those. Grab a sandwich, talk to a friend, get a counsellor, do some yoga, go for a walk, take a nap, have a glass of water. Whatever. But never will the addiction truly feed one of the HALT needs.

**- Find your medicine, and take it daily.**

For me, I discovered that going on a walk was like medicine to me. It really grounds me and makes me feel better. But the thing about it, is that it only works when I actually do it. Go figure. So I decided I had to treat it like prescribed medicine. Take one dose daily before 10am. No discussion. Non-negotiable. Take it.

**- Know that your addiction / your brain will lie to you.**

Did you know that your thoughts are not universal truths? That they actually are just words in your brain and you can choose to ignore them, dispute them, etc? WOW. When this was explained to me, it was very helpful. If I have the thought, ""I am worthless"" - that doesn't make it true, just because I've thought it. I can actually say, ""Hey, that's a thought. I must be feeling bad right now. What can I do to give myself a hug?"" And other lies: ""I don't think I'm actually addicted, I can mange to do just a little..."" Play the tape. Don't believe the lies. Let those thoughts float through your head and fly away like a bird in the sky.

**- Find a system or routine that works.**

Is it a group that meets? Is it a book by Alan Carr? Is it podcasts? Is it close friends? Whatever it is, stick with it. Get into routine about it. I fell off the wagon when I stopped talking to my sponsor. I'm back on now, and I'm hoping that by talking to a wider net of people I'll avoid fighting this in isolation.

**- Learn about shame and guilt.**

Speakers like Brene Brown (shame) and Alan Watts (guilt) have some good things about shame and guilt. I found it very helpful to learn about these emotions. They don't serve you. They don't help you move forward. Let go of shame and guilt.

**- Thinking of others.**

Reaching out to others that might need support, gets me out of my own head and focusing on something else. I find it really helpful and it makes me feel good to make others feel good. Today I'm making muffins for my neighbour whose kitten died. So sad. But yeah. Thinking of how to make others feel better stops me from dwelling on my own pain.

**- Positive escapism:**

Awesome books and movies that give me a nice mental break are amaaaaaazing and I'm always happier when I can find some fun diversions.

**- Making a list of mantras/quotes/questions/reminders that help. These are mine:**

* **Each day we are born again.**
* **Changed behaviour is the best apology.**
* **Every day is a new day.**
* **Joy cannot be bought.**
* **Struggles are crucial because they're transformative. Struggles can change people for the better.**
* **Grief is a cocoon from which we emerge new. (Glennon Doyle?)**
* **We can do hard things. - Glennon Doyle**
* **These mountains you carry, you were only supposed to climb. - Najwa Zebian**
* **""Failures"" are not to be regretted, but instead celebrated as steppingstones to later success.**
* **Recovering addicts often have more empathy for others.**
* **Sobriety is the capacity to savour.**
* **Recognizing, resisting, relaxing, resolving.**
* **Perfection is an illusion.**
* **More leads to more, and less leads to less.**
* **How easily would you spend $5k elsewhere?**
* **The opposite of addiction, is connection.**
* **Fear and appreciation cannot exist in your brain at the same time.**

Well, did I miss anything? Anyone out there have some new ideas for me on how to get through this? Power to everyone that's fighting a battle to better themselves.",1614042456

As a kid I used to walk to the corner stores and buy snacks. I always loved getting my favorite foods when my mom went grocery shopping. As I got older food became more scarce for me. At least the food I really liked and enjoyed. I remember when my ex and I started making decent money and I think that’s when it really happened. It was more so about the ability to eat at restaurants we really couldn’t before. To enjoy take out on a regular basis. My jobs have played a role too. Up at 7am not returning home until 10hrs later sometimes. Too lazy to pack lunches most days but also thrilled to eat fresh fast food on my breaks. 

For a while it was fun. I wasn’t gaining too much weight. I was young and still very ambitious. Now fast forward to the present. I’m 33 and still ambitious but very much overweight with a food problem. It’s seemingly only gotten worse over the last year. I now find myself binge eating even after having a meal. Tonight after dinner I took the opportunity to get my son something from the store to get a small meal from McDonald’s. It’s truly sad and pathetic. I know better! 

The signs are all around me to stop. I’ve become uncomfortably overweight. My wife isn’t as attracted to me as she was. My health as declined some. High blood pressure, headaches and all kinds of other aches.

I’m motivated some days and others I’m not. Sometimes I think I’m depressed but buy into. I’m a naturally joyful person. I just need help with my food addiction and overall health!",1614075150

Please help me out here..I don’t know what to think of this.,
My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. He was with his highschool girlfriend for 10 years before me. During their relationship he struggled with depression, social anxiety and subsequently addiction. She couldn’t deal with it and cheated on him many times and talked to everyone about his private problems. After my bf found out, he broke up with her and was devastated and everything spiralled out of control. Additionally she then got together with his best friend. He resents her a lot and when he mentions her, he mostly gets angry. 
Fast forward to now.. he’s still struggling with the things that happened and he feels ashamed and paranoid that everybody knows about his personal problems. He told me this from the start and I completely understood he needed time to process everything.
At the moment he’s in therapy and will have the opportunity to invite family for a therapy session. He told me today that he wants to ask his ex. They haven’t been in touch since they broke up and he says he has no feelings for her. 

I was pretty shocked and kind of hurt that he wants to involve her in the process. 
I don’t see how it can be helpful to talk to her. I know he wants to hear from her that she is sorry but that isn’t going to change what happened either. He said he wants her to know what she caused.
The last year has been hard because of his addiction and definitely put a strain on our relationship as well. I mentioned several times that I would like to be involved as well in therapy,!as I would like some help or tips to deal with his addiction and how to move forward together.
 I feel like he’s not trying to work on a future with me. Am I being selfish here? What do you think?",1614067286

Weed free for almost 3 days! Someone give me a high fuckin' 5. I got this.,134,lp90yz,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lp90yz/weed_free_for_almost_3_days_someone_give_me_a/,28,"I've smoked weed every single day for the past 13 years with the exception of a couple of very short breaks. Even during those times, I swapped my weed out with alcohol, or xanex. I genuinely don't know if I've been a whole 24 hours, totally sober, in 13 years. Not this time, no weed, no alcohol, nothing!


My partner has still been smoking. I have still been sitting with him whilst he is smoking. An oz of weed is just chilling on my living room table. I thought I had no willpower. I've never been able to say no to a joint. I didn't want to have no weed in the house and try to quit. I think if I couldn't see it, or know that I couldnt have one if I reeeeeaaaally wanted one, it would be too unbearable.

People say weed is not addictive, they are full of shit. I am (was) dependant on it. Cant eat, sleep or even shit properly and my stomach is constantly in knots. I'm hoping my bodily functions will return to normal soon. 


I am really proud of myself. I really needed to come to this subreddit to let you all know, if I can do it.. YOU SURE AS HELL CAN DO IT. I don't want to get ahead of myself as it is only day 3, but today has felt easier than yesterday and the day before. The only way is up, right?


Meditation has been a godsend. Specifically the Monroe Hemi-Sync tapes. If you haven't explored them, take reading this as fate. It is your time to start.


Whatever you are all battling, take every moment as it comes. If anyone needs support, please reach out. Never be too disappointed if you haven't reached your goal today, there's always tomorrow and I have full faith you can do it.

Long Post.",1,lq2orn,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lq2orn/need_some_advice_or_maybe_just_some_words_of/,1,"Don't really know where to begin. I have a depressive personality and have been diagnosed with BPD traits in the past. Ever since childhood, I have been dealing with emotional issues. My father being a surgeon, I had easy access to prescription medications at my home. As a teenager, I got into the habit of abusing painkillers and codeine syrups. It wasn't too bad. I didn't use daily. I was suffering from heavy depression and insomnia, and i would use maybe 3 nights a week on average. I stopped when I went to college.
I started smoking cigarettes and pot at 18, alcohol at 19. At 20 I realised I am really prone to addiction, and that awareness kept me from trying anything harder in college. But I was smoking a pack a day, was stoned all the time, and the drinking kept getting worse. I failed 2 years of college and had to start seeing a therapist to deal with the emotional issues.
I was able to stop drinking daily when I was 24. Couldn't lay off the pot and cigarettes though. It ruined college for me. It took me 7 years to graduate engineering school (normal is 4 in my country). But laying off the alcohol cleared my mind a bit and I found my calling as a scriptwriter. It was hard to function normally while high on pot, I tried limiting it but couldn't really manage it.
Last year in march, right before my 26th birthday, I quit cigarette. My ability to do so encouraged me, and I was able to quit pot in July. I haven't smoked pot since.
The problem now is, whenever I read or watch something where a character struggles with addiction, I feel myself falling back. I have been back at my parents place for a couple of months, and while watching Euphoria, I slipped and had a bit of codeine. Currently I'm watching The Sopranos, and the arc of a character dealing with H addiction got me twitchy again. Yesterday I took some painkillers. Today I had my first cigarette in 11 months.
The thing is that being a writer, I have to watch and read stuff. I can't really avoid that. But I need to be able to deal with it, or else I will fall back into my old habits. I wanna stay clean. I don't mind having a joint once in a while, or a drink on occasions. But I can't afford to feel weak the way I feel while watching these characters struggle with their addictions. I don't wanna use just because I felt the urge.

I am an addict of weed gabapentin and benzodiazepines in my opinion.  I need to pass a hair follicle test to get this apprenticeship opportunity.  I need to get sober of weed which I smoked 2 or 3 boof carts and plenty weed each week and Xanax or Percocet and many gabapentin while I drown myself in Hennessy, bud light and Jameson after work 😂😰.  Last Sunday I took about 3 grams of gabapentin and drank approximately 550ml of Hennessy vs and 6 Budweiser.  I later smoked all the empty carts and leftover weed before I had quit.  I cried for hours to my girlfriend and it really felt like more tears I’ve ever cried in my life.  I have been shielded and blinded my whole life.  I also today kept on keeping on and relapsed.

I'm a 25 year old guy and I have been smoking hash for about 10 years now. I've also been a heavy drinker for nearly 8 years though my alcohol consumption has gone down to once every couple of months in the past two years. 

The thing I really struggle with is my hash addiction as I regularly smoke at least 12-15 joints a day on my own and every time I try to stop I fall back even harder on it. I almost dropped out of uni because of being extremely lazy and wasting my life away. 

My alcohol addiction stopped when I ruined my relationship with the love of my life. I cant stop smoking up. I haven't smoked up in a week and I am suffering from extremely bad withdrawal symptoms that include
- migraines
- restlessness 
- sleep deprivation 
- nightmares/extremely uneasy and shitty sleep
- insomnia 
- extremely high levels of anxiety and depression that has made existence unbearable to the point I cant function 
- fatigue 
- total disconnect from everyone and everything around me
- anger out bursts. 

These are the ones I can remember at the moment. 
What I want help with is some guidance as to how I can quit smoking up. Anything I read online is extremely generic and doesnt work. I just need some help from someone who can understand me I guess.",1613974476

I’ll masturbate every day and sometimes more than once a day. Sometimes I’ll masturbate and cum, then keep going until I cum again, and then I’ll have came 5 times over an hour and I could still keep going. 

I’m never not horny ever since I stopped taking birth control a year ago. The horniness just stays within me.

Today I am on my period and I masturbated and had the WORST cramps after. (This sometimes happens and I talked to my OBGYN about it and they said it’s normal for the uterus to contract after.) It was excruciating pain though. 

Well now I know if I masturbate again I will be in excruciating pain again, but I’m so itching to masturbate. I never thought I had a problem before but now all I want to do is cum. I don’t know what to do.

I'm lost,2,losajh,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/losajh/im_lost/,5,"I am 28 years old. I have been in and out of AA since the age of 19 and am currently 7 days sober from primarily THC. I cannot think simply enough to ""just surrender"" and embrace AA.

Alcoholism, or insert drug of choice, is a ""thinking disease"" as described in the Big Book. I understand how unwavering belief in a Higher Power would help mitigate these adverse thinking patterns/reinforced pathways in my brain. I suppose I'm discovering my recently developed agnosticism, in saying that. Rather than just believing without question, I merely see how unwavering belief could alleviate alot of my negative thoughts, emotions, and, thus, behavior.

I understand how I lack control over a portion of my thoughts, probably more than I even realize. I can only control how I respond to them. I'd imagine I'm much less in control of craving thoughts (especially early in sobriety) as the chemical response from drugs is very strong compared to ""everyday life"" stimuli. 

As I'm writing this, along with every past attempt at ""never using again"", I genuinely realize how much better life goes for me in sobriety. However, AA just doesnt ""click"" all the way like it seemingly has to for it to work. I'm always trying to understand what's causing these repetitive thoughts followed by poor decisions (especially in active addiction), rather than just accepting I'm ""powerless"" as a blanket explanation. I've said this to my sponsor (and likened AA to horoscopes, which he didnt like) and it was unsurprisingly met with ""your best thinking got you here"". I frequently believe that AA and the idea of ""powerlessness"" leads to self-fulfilling prophecies and feeds the cycle for me.

 ""You've got to put AA 1st above ALL else"" is the biggest turnoff that led to this questioning. I was merely existing in addiction, very isolated and distanced from loved ones. I didnt get sober to live in fear of relapse. AA describes fear as the root of all of our problems, so why does it seem like it's the root of their solution? 

If I dont go to a meeting every day of the week, I'm ""falling short"" and ""nearing the next drink""...the list of things ""suggested"" seems to just grow. It's common for sponsors to force meeting attendance, especially home group, even before important family events (scheduled in advance) just to make sure I am keeping sobriety 1st on the list. The common response is ""you wouldn't be there if you weren't sober"" (whether in the physical  or mental sense). That's the point though, I AM SOBER TO BE PRESENT FOR LIFE.

 I want to understand more what is physically occurring in my brain (much like mental health diagnoses that I also do not accept, but that's another story/post) and how to rewire these negative pathways I've reinforced through several separate periods of substance abuse.

 This is something that has been on my mind but buried for awhile now.",1613923403
My mom is addicted to a variety of drugs and is mentally ill,7,lolett,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lolett/my_mom_is_addicted_to_a_variety_of_drugs_and_is/,8,"Hi everyone. Never had a reddit before but I have gotten desperate and afraid enough to reach out and see if anyone had any advice for my problem. My mother had cancer twice and multiple surgeries over ten years ago and during this time her husband cheated on her. Throughout this time I spent middle and high school with my own problems and also the emotional turmoil from what my mother was going through. My siblings and I were her only support during this time and there was a lot of fighting between my parents that involved my infant brother and the police were called multiple times. I distinctly remember waking up crying and throwing up almost every morning from anxiety about what the future would hold. Fast forward some years and I made a 4.0 in high school, earned a STEM degree, and have involvement with an industry I really want to work for. I had a great internship happening the summer of 2019, but once COVID hit, I lost all my opportunities and had to move back home (I had to move out of my place for the internship). I have been here ever since. Before I moved back home and would only visit, I noticed my mom was getting dangerously thin, as in, severely underweight. Since I have been back, she has declined even more physically and mentally. There are a lot of days that she simply will not eat ANYTHING. Most days she makes herself eat at least one thing. Other days she will get hungry and eat a lot of food. I am posting here because ever since her cancer and surgeries, she has been hooked on a variety of drugs. She has been on a combination of muscle relaxers, pain killers, anxiety medication, blood pressure pills, sleeping pills, cigarettes, and marijuana all at the same time for years. These years have been nothing but constant fights with her doctors about needing pain meds for the pain she still has after over ten years from the reconstructive surgeries (she had a double masectomy and reconstructive surgeries). Many doctors have told her that she should not be feeling pain still and they have done numerous tests, scans, and have found nothing, and keep trying to get her off the pain pills. I have heard from others that have gotten off of pain pills that once they did, their body was able to heal properly in regards to the pain they felt. Aside from the physical addiction aspect, there are other important factors at play. I highly suspect she is also mentally ill, she at least has depression and definitely generalized anxiety, but maybe also BPD. I make assumptions because she refuses to see anyone that can help her even though she has the resources to do so and is extremely stubborn. She is also heavily into conspiracy theories and believes she is waiting for God to fix her problems. She is not even 60 yet and has a lot of great years ahead of her and I cannot fucking stand seeing her do this to herself anymore. About the cheating husband - he doesn't OPENLY cheat at the moment but there are a shitload of other issues in their marriage right now. The mental and emotional issues run deep with my mother and there's more to this than a physical addiction to drugs. She is withering away more each day, her teeth are falling out, I can see most of her bones, and she is getting more and more fantastical and illogical with her beliefs. I am watching this unfold right in front of me and I really want to fix this. My siblings and I have absorbed all of her problems over the years and are depressed as well. We are actually afraid to move out right now because no one wants to leave her in the condition that she's in. Also, the last time we all left (college, military, internship, etc.) she had a breakdown and tried to kill herself. I am so sorry if this post doesn't make sense, but I have felt so lost for pretty much my entire life, with my mom and her problems always haunting the back of my mind. I want to get out and live my life again and I want the same for my brothers and sister. My mom needs help and I thought it would start with the addictions, but now that I have written this post, I think the issues causing her addictions need to be addressed first, in therapy. I have no idea where to start but I do know that my mom not eating and putting all these drugs into her body every single day is literally killing her. I appreciate any advice anyone can offer.",1613898237

ADHD and addiction. Need advice.,1,lomxz4,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lomxz4/adhd_and_addiction_need_advice/,6,"Hello r/addiction,

Just to preface, this post is not meant for using anyone's advice to ""secure a diagnosis"", I am merely looking for peace of mind.

So  I have repeatedly dealt with hallmark symptoms of ADHD my entire life  such as hit-or-miss focus, disorganization, time blindness and  confidence issues which stem partly from what I believe to be ADHD.  Since I was 19 (25 today) I have used substances to make up for these  mental shortcomings and it developed into polysubstance abuse where my  preferable drugs of choice are cannabis and stimulants of any kind. I  had this idea of possibly having ADHD while I had been sober for 4  months though  I did break my sobriety streak at the end of January this  year.

However, ever since I relapsed I have been wondering whether or how ADHD psychs treat patients  who along with (possibly) having ADHD, have a history of substance  abuse and I hope to get some input from you guys in the r/addiction community.  It is worth noting that I have been receiving treatment for depression since the summer of 2019 but haven't had much success.

I brought this topic up with my psych but he refuses to prescribe  stimulants as a principle and even if he did I doubt he would prescribe  an addict like myself. This sort of mindset is very draining and I doubt  that it's justified but that's why I post here hoping for some  reassurance I suppose. In light of my psych situation I booked an  appointment with a psych who specializes in ADHD on Monday and once  again hope to have some doubts cleared.",1613903453

Watching the character spiral down on coke addiction triggered my memories on my own past spiral down in a nasty way. I came here seeking for a place to vent my thoughts, since I haven’t been to therapy since late 2019. Maybe it’s time to go back. 

As I said before, I was severely hooked up on cocaine back in 2015/16. And I managed to escape, to rebuild my life to be successful, I mean very very successful. I am right now at a place people envy and admire me. 

So the addiction is not a problem anymore... Or is it? I am feeling bad today. I still have a problem. 

I go out maybe once or twice a month. And I drink. Gosh, I drink. If I’m at home I get a glass of wine or a beer and that’s it. A glass of wine once in a while is not bad. But when I go to a bar with friends I absolutely cannot stop myself. I drink like a maniac! I chain-smoke. And I crave coke and always end up doing it. Last night I went on a bender and fucked it again. Two fat lines. Countless drinks. Sipping gin out of the bottle. The hangover is not too bad. But I feel so bad! Emotionally fractured.  Why do I do this? I don’t hate myself anymore. I don’t want to kill myself anymore. But I can’t control myself around booze. Maybe it’s time to accept I’m a coke addict and also an alcoholic? 

I avoided accepting that my whole adult life. I never admitted to be an alcoholic. I don’t drink at 8am on a Monday. Never. I don’t drink on a Wednesday afternoon. I drink twice a month, on a Friday night, and I do coke and smoke a pack of cigarettes. Does not hurt my life. BUT I DON’T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE, AND I CAN’T STOP!! 

I don’t want to feel guilty, because guilty isn’t helpful. But I can’t help feeling bad for being so weak. For being so damn hypocritical. I can help people and give awesome advice but I can’t stop myself from slowly and painfully killing myself. This may seem to be an exaggeration - oh she only drinks twice a month... But I waste myself twice a month, you know? And I can’t stop it. 

I go booze free for two or three weeks fine, Fridays on the couch watching tv with my son. But after two or three weeks, as Friday approaches, I start to feel uneasy, agitated, I can’t focus properly on other stuff, anticipating the moment I will get to drink and smoke and snort. I was chugging down negronis last night. One after another. The bar closed early because of cv19 restrictions. I went to my friend’s place, because he had coke. Then went to another friend’s place because the after party moved there. 

This is the story of my life. Even before I got hooked on coke, I was already drinking in this same pattern, even more because I’d go out every Friday. Now it’s not as often.  

My point is: I WANT TO STOP. I don’t want to love gin as much as I do anymore. I don’t want to crave it as much as I crave cocaine. 

I need to admit I am an addict and I am an alcoholic. And I need help. Again.

The downside is I’m conditioned to the devices and get on it after not falling asleep after awhile in bed because of how the addiction affects one or more the mentioned hormones/neurotransmitters.

I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I just needed to write it down. I feel kind of numb. My father has suffered with addiction for a long time and finally today it came to a boil again.

My mother is leaving him and I'm momentarily stuck and unable to live anywhere else due to the pandemic. When it happened I was online teaching a class. My mother was in the background, screaming, panicking, trying to help this 300 pound man from hitting his head against the table, and here I am in an online class with 6 teenagers, trying to keep it together. Now I'm just stuck in this...strange mood. As if I'm preparing myself for some sort of hurt. But I don't feel much. I can't even cry.

We are all going to have to find clarity within ourselves. That clarity is increasingly under fire from our own culture. And for every one of us alive today we were born into it so we may have never experienced true clarity in our lives before.

If I actually sleep, it is in small chunks and is routinely interrupted by that falling feeling and I wake up thinking that I am not breathing. My past haunts me in these moments of silence. My self hatred gets magnified and I have to sit reflect on the insane mess that I have created. Eventually I sneak out of bed and sit in the living room.

I think of my home as a Skinner-box (the ones used to study drug-behaviour in rats), and it has recently dawned on me that if I want to stay clean, I need to change the environment that surrounds me. If I stay in my ""Skinner-box"" it's inevatible that i will start using again. Just as the rats in said study.

So as of yesterday I've begun that change. Currently I'm in the process of painting the walls in an attempt to get rid of some of the ghosts. I hope a fresh layer of paint will conceal them.

I've also removed the ""junkie-blinds"" from the windows. You know old sheets that was meant to be temporary, but remained for year after year after year. And guess what? Light actually penetrates the windows, illuminating the room...wow!

No wonder I've been so depressed.

It actually looks good, and I can't wait to see it in a month or 2. Next step will be to get rid of all the smelly, broken, burned and destroyed stuff and changing it with something that makes me happy and I actually appreciate.

The best thing though is the calmness i feel within myself. I'm actually doing something good for a change, and I'm doing it for me. It gives me a feeling of certainty.

However, businesses of all sorts coax our brains to release dopamine. When that happens we embrace the shallows of transactional relationships. The truth is that what we want is within us and cannot be manufactured. Nobody has our answer. No product is the key. No path is correct. The problem is that we have developed an addiction to our own dopamine response. We feel good when we're getting ""more,"" but it is the exact thing getting in the way of our being more.

The Spider,41,ln33zr,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ln33zr/the_spider/,12," 

    Working in the same rehabilitation center I got sober in helped me stay grounded. It helped me stay focused on my recovery. It was nice. Then Covid hit. They fired 8 employees and I was one of the lucky winners. It was back in 2019 when I got hired; me and one of the guys I went through the program with. Fresh out of the program. They shipped him to the other side of Florida, to work at the Pinellas facility. He was also in the ""you're fired"" group. Hired the same day, fired the same day. He went back home after the layoffs. He made it about two weeks before he overdosed. He died January 20th 2021. 

 You see nine times out of ten, the people that come to treatment have lost everything. Rock bottom as they say. Generally, it takes a real calamity to motivate an addict to seek help. Their lives have crumbled. Their world is upside down. So, most of the time clients are completely starting over, rebuilding from the rubble. Desperation, denial, pain, suffering, loss, hopelessness. An overwhelming sense of loneliness. All of these things drop on their head like an anvil when they sober up and they have no choice but to confront them. They have no choice but to confront themselves. True introspection is a foundation of recovery. Addicts in recovery have to look inside, but if they don’t understand what they are looking at, they may as well be blind. Most people are terrified of themselves, whether they know it or not. Shame and guilt. The self-ridicule begins. 

“Look at you. Look what you’ve done. You have ruined everything. You have no purpose; you have no place.” 

 Being an addict going into rehab, I felt as if I have been thrown away by society, or by my family, and I knew it was my fault. The vision of my future went blank. My perception of the present was just a kaleidoscope of raw devastation and unregulated emotion.  

 Getting sober, drying out, detoxing. It’s grueling, painful. It’s physiological torture. But you would be surprised what you can do when you have no choice, when you are cornered and out of options. But what happens when you are back upright. When you learn how to play that shit hand life dealt you. When you are doing everything right; staying clean, going to work every day, exercising, getting closer to your goals. When you start to feel what it's like, to actually be proud of yourself. What happens when you do everything by the book and still, life decides to blindside you with another fucking catastrophe. As an addict, maintaining sobriety during a crisis can feel like swallowing a live grenade. You want to explode engulfing everything around you. There is no hiding from the threat. No running. Because it is you. Your mind. It’s your thoughts, beliefs and emotions. An intricate spiderweb of cognition and you are tangled in it. If you don’t somehow untangle yourself quick enough, that ominous spider that is your addiction, will eat you alive and you will let it.

""why am i doing this to myself?"" not because i'm weak, or lazy, or broken. because it is how i have learned to survive and cope, by holding on to these few minutes of pleasure within days filled with pain. and i was in so much pain that i just kept trying to medicate, over and over, more and more, for so long that i just got lost in it. and i let it take control of me. the stress and intensity of the self soothing became its own kind of damage. and that is how my addiction came to be. 

addiction is just self soothing that gets out of control. when someone is in so much pain, they abuse that method of pleasure to the point of obsession.

My brother is an addict,1,ln7rj1,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ln7rj1/my_brother_is_an_addict/,5,"I tried. He got involved with an older woman and they happened to fall into drugs together, meth mainly. He was with her for a couple years. She was violent, had previous charges against her for road rage and such. My brother is a friendly giant but if she called the cops on him? Obviously they’d believe her. It wasn’t until a bartender showed the cops footage of her hitting him on camera that they let him go (the second time). Still she played the victim to my family, even though we knew full well she was lying. She’s a narcissist. 
He houses her at my mothers place for a while, completely against her wishes but she relents. He asks for money, steals money from his 10 yo nephew under the same roof, my family doesn’t have the heart to kick them out so two months later they decide to push up their plans to move. 

Eventually he hit rock bottom long enough (homeless in LA in the winter which tbh could be worst). He agrees to move north with me, away from that woman. I find a rehab for him, pay for his airbnb for a couple months (bf at the time owned guns and my brother was a felon due to the domestic violence accusations), until there’s a bed. Pay for his first month. His unemployment pays for the second. He decides he’s ready to go i to sober living. Doesn’t stay longer than a month, older sober residents are too “naggy.”  Holds a job for a while, old car he bought breaks down and he stops working. Gets comfortable in unemployment and instead of saving to get another car, falla into old habita he KNOWS will lead him into a downward spiral. I try. I’m his older sister. I TRY. he tells me he knows what’s happening. I try to convince him to go back to rehab. He can save his unemployment, use it to pay. But he says he meeds to do it himself, for himself. 

He relapses. Apparently he has a couple times already. I know from the way he avoids my calls. His roommate knows. Apparently he’s been lying and has gone to visit that woman several times in the last eight months or so. She leaves him hateful voicemails, wants him to die, insults his family, hallucinates that he’s “hurting” her and is deliberately sabotaging her life and is the reason she is losing custody of her son, supposedly part of some huge conspiracy to that end. But he keeps going back to her. SHE is clearly his drug. 

He relapses bad. Says he’s going back to LA, leaving his cat and abandoning his roommate. He asks me to pick up his stuff. I’m pissed. I gave him that cat. The second one I trusted him with (the first I took back after his gf picked her up and THREW her at him in a drunken stupor). I picked her up and find out his roommate knew nothing. His roommate is a recovering addict, but he has a child he needs to work hard for and is a month into his recovery. He loves my brother, but is starting to recognize his narcissistic fleas. A week or so later, he finds needles in the closet where he puts his child’s teething toys and warns me to tell my brother never to come back. 

My brother plays the victim. But he tries rehab again. And then two months later, she finds him and he leaves for her. And then the downward spiral. He keeps breaking into my sisters house though she keeps asking him to stay away. My mom, who lives with her, started having heart attack symptoms. He seemingly had no reaction. He was so far gone. 

At which point do you start holding someone accountable? I’m pissed. He’s hurting my family. Yea, addiction is a disease, but he kept making LUCID decisions to go back. He did everything in his power possible to keep giving into his triggers. I know other addicts. I was an addict. But the difference is we chose to do everything in our power to AVOID our triggers. 

He sent a text to my mother saying he doesn’t want to be a part of the family anymore because she only “pretends” to care and just lies to him all the time. She just.. sat there.. staring at the message. She has already lost her eldest to addiction 15 years ago. Now she is losing her youngest. How am I supposed to not despise him?

Sorry for the huge wall of text.

Lost in translation?,1,ln4ct0,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ln4ct0/lost_in_translation/,1,"OK. So I've been going through some things here recently. I hope and pray that I am able to fully articulate my struggle and explain my reasoning behind everything going on and why I did what I felt best.

I'll start by saying I was 2 years sober when the pandemic started. Covid cost me 2 jobs, a house, and a relationship. I was starting to crack at the seams and on April 29th, it happened. Trump gave me my stimulus on the worst day of the year. I don't blame Trump, or the extra influx of money into my account. I blame myself and a lack of accountability. But I relapsed. I spent 3 weeks in hell and caught a case. I bonded out and got myself together.

However that did not last long, a few months later I relapsed again. Spent another few weeks in hell and got myself together before getting into trouble. All the while I wasn't really in contact with my sponsor or anyone from recovery.

But this time different, I decided to reach out. I decided to ask for help. And help is what I thought I got. I moved into sober living, was going to meetings and doing the steps all over again. Life was great! Or so it seemed.

Then I started to notice how judgemental a Nast majority of the recovery community in my city was. It was like being in catholic church again. Do this or goto hell. Do this or die. Do this and God hates you! So I chose to keep my head down and my circle small. But somehow the judgemental cesspool which is the indy recovery scene just seemed to seep its way in. The you're not part of the ""cool"" kids table really started to show thru. Everytime I reached out, everywhere I turned I saw fake hope and people lying. People judging and people ultimately hating on myself or others who seemed to be doing good.

Anyways fast forward a few months and I made the ultimate decision to remove myself entirely from the recovery community. It's not that I want to smoke dope. I don't. It's not that I want to be a waste of life and die a lonely man. I don't. But I don't want to surround myself with that hatred, the lack of real empathy for another's struggles. And the people who were ""in crowders"" or cool kids as I call them looking down on everyone and making me feel bad for anything.

I deleted 90%of my recovery related friends. Removed myself from all the local recovery groups on fb, and have basically isolated myself to a small group of family and friends. Am I setting myself up for a relapse? Have I done what I always do and convinced myself of lies? Or is it possible that I'm right and the recovery community not helping in ways I thought were ""why we do it"" the reasons for my relapses?

Again idk if I'm articulating my struggles or giving a fully accurate time line of events bc this is all off the top of my head. But any advice would be much appreciated! Much love and respect!",1613730686

These days it is easy to see the world closing off. With everything that has happened, and continues to happen, in 2020 no one would blame us for closing off a bit. There is nothing in it for us, however.  


Closing off, to not welcome change, or simply offering resistance is no longer an option. There was once a time where saying ""No"" to something new was the easiest way forward, while saying ""Yes"" to toxic friends and relationships also seemed the least intrusive. Today we are more important than that, we are more than that in every way, but we have to step forward in order to experience it, we have to try no matter how much or how little. Changing our lives happens by the slightest shifts so if we can open up just the least amount possible today, tomorrow will be a brand new day.

Dipping my toe into 12 Step program research but unsure if traditional AA/NA groups are correct for my addictions.,2,lmpdbq,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lmpdbq/dipping_my_toe_into_12_step_program_research_but/,6,"First time posting here so bear with me and I'll add a TL;DR at the end.

31 / M for context if it helps.

It's my 1 year anniversary of starting therapy for severe depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma. As we have progressed through the year I have come to terms with my active involvement in gambling addiction and severe nicotine addiction (2+ packs per day, vaporizers, nicotine mints/gum, snus on a regular basis and 2-3 premium cigars a day when the weather permits). I have a history of sex addiction when I was younger and borderline alcoholism (mostly as a form of passive suicide). Though I don't believe I've hit my ""bottom"" I am slowly coming to term with the trauma these addictions cause myself and others, most importantly my fiancé.

The past few sessions of therapy I've attended have had a recurring theme of 12 Step programs and whether I am open to the idea. I made good on my promise this week to start reading about it and pick up a devotional book to skim through. The more I read the more I feel a sense of understanding that I truly am an addict (which I guess is how it's supposed to work).

The problem I'm having is there is a nagging feeling that if I take my therapists offer of going to group I will be out of place as I'm neither an alcoholic (runs in the family though) nor a user of any narcotics. My understanding of these groups are that while they deal with the struggles of addiction they are usually specialized in the type of addiction associated with their titles. 

I know that there are resources available for gambling addiction. 

I know sex addiction is slowly becoming more recognized.

I know that nicotine addiction is extremely difficult to kick for the majority of users. 

What I don't know is whether I truly belong in a traditional 12 Step group.

I don't know if I would be accepted.

TL;DR I'm curious to know if anyone has any insight on whether traditional AA/NA groups are right for other addictions.",1613691203

Once we identify strongly with something it is not easy to shift away from that. If we identify as a dancer, for instance, it may destroy us to become injured. But injuries happen, and when they do we may very well be resistant to change course due to our how we experience our identity. This can be the same if we identify as a victim. When we find relationships that don't victimize us, we may distance ourselves as we are resistant to the change.  


I am a proponent of having a strong and flexible mind. Working with clients it's important for me to have them become aware of where they have rigid thinking. When we get stuck trying to get hard answers it is often due to an inability to be flexible.  


Being flexible in, and aware of, our thoughts allows us the space to grow beyond our old identities. Keep your mind limber and keep questioning ""Why?"" because having the answer to ""What"" doesn't get us as far as we would be led to believe.

idk if this is an addiction???,1,lmqjvs,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lmqjvs/idk_if_this_is_an_addiction/,9,"Things have taken a severe downward spiral in my life recently, & the further back I trace it the more it scares me.

The first time I drank I was 10 or 11 - went to a sleepover, some some beers and got buzzed in a friend's camper. Don't think much of it. A year later, I picked up an addiction to caffeine so bad that I couldn't function without three or four cups of coffee every morning. By middle school, I was waking up at 7, chugging 4 cups of coffee, heading to school, crashing at 3, drinking more coffee, staying up until 2 AM texting my gf, and finally passing out around 4. I wish it had stopped there.

Through high school, I siphoned off my parents' alcohol when they were out and drank alone in my room most nights to sleep. By college, espresso and wine was legit all I drank. I thought I was fine because coffee is a socially acceptable addiction & everyone laughed when I joked about how tired I was, & a couple glasses of wine daily is still considered light drinking - never mind that I was literally giving myself kidney damage from the dehydration. Sometime in the interim between high school and my disastrous first attempt at college, I got a medical marijuana card for chronic pain, though, & that's where the real issue started.

I started getting stoned basically every night. At first it was great and I was stoked to have a way to manage the pain, but in a couple of months I noticed my school performance was going downhill. So I started drinking more coffee. And more. And more. Once I hit 7 4-shot lattes a day & had quit eating, I wanted to make a change.

So I saw a shrink, who diagnosed me with ADHD. Makes sense. I had tried basically every non stimulant med on the market, so we tried Adderall. And holy fuck, did I love Adderall.

I was only on 5mg/day, but I could finally do what I needed to do during the day. I could smoke more and still be functional as long as I took my pills in the morning. By the middle of the semester I was given the prescription, I was taking 20mg in the early morning, another 20 at 11 AM, another 10 at 2 if I crashed, and 40 when I got off work in the evenings so I could go out and party until 3 AM. Then I started taking IR with XR. Then IR, XR, & vynase all at once.

This was all well and good until I ended up in the hospital in late February, having seizures and terrible back pain, where I did not take the Adderall they gave me, & instead hoarded it to save it for later. I was sweaty all the time but the seizures stopped, and when I started sleeping again, I had dreams of my cat's face melting off. I stayed off the Adderall through the remainder of spring break, and the pain and seizures vanished, undiagnosed, finally treated with prescriptions for Gabapentin and Indomethacin.

I never restarted the Adderall after spring break, because COVID happened. I suddenly had nowhere to get coffee besides my own home, and no reason, exactly, to get up early or late or even at all for unscheduled online classes. So in place of Adderall, one day I smoked weed before my online class, just to deal with the boredom of sitting through a lecture consisting of no visuals but my professor's disembodied face on my laptop screen. And then I did it again. And again. Until I was permastoned, going through between six and ten joints a day, and still popping the Gabapentin my neurologist gave me for the unexplained numbness and pain.

And then, I was victim to medical malpractice in July. After this, my system was so fucked that even weed ended up damaging my liver, but I just kept smoking more and more. I stopped my antidepressants to free up more liver space to keep smoking weed without getting hepatitis. By the time I was too sick to smoke, I was in a car crash; in the ER, they put me down a k hole when they reset the bones sticking out of my right arm. When the hospital released me, I had nowhere to go; my parents refused to take me in.

So now, I'm staying with my childhood best friend's family, familiar figures in passing by if I'm being honest, total strangers, who were kind enough to take me in. My girlfriend dumped me about a week ago for the way I'd been treating her, and rightfully so. The weed cravings is finally managed to kick came back with a vengeance, and between the despair and resisting the urge to smoke, I ended up trying to kill myself. 

So now I'm back to smoking weed, because after blacking out in a noose I was too terrified to sleep, and I'm taking shrooms and starting ketamine infusions soon for depression/ptsd. But I just have to wonder... am I always going to be like this?

The shrooms seem to be helping, but I'm afraid it's too late to turn my life around. I know I'm not addicted to anything hard or whatever, and maybe I'm not even really an addict at all, but the intensity with which I lose myself in whatever drug I'm into terrifies me. I'm afraid this will be how I end up addicted to ketamine, too, but I've legit tried every other medication on the market and idk how else to feel better so I won't kill myself. 

I know I could cancel the treatment if I did really want to, but the urge is so strong I can't make the call. It's a huge yikes all around. I have no idea how to get better or make myself want to quit the drugs, but I'm worried about where this is taking me.

Sorry this was so long!

(A glimpse into the best thing someone ever told me: my teen mentor met up with me for lunch after I got married. They apologized for not advocating for me more and seeking to get the help my brother and I needed. Their honestly spoke such raw love over me.)

If you feel comfortable, I would be honored to share and experience you had with someone giving their unsolicited input or reach out with the perfect words. 

Please feel free to comment or DM me. For those that I collaborate with and include in the zine, I will send you a free copy. 💛

So much love for everyone here, I see you and am with you. You are amazing and WORTHY!",1613693614

I also like cocaine, but I don’t use it too often. Recently, I bought some and used for 3 days, approx. 4 or 5 lines per day. The last day I figured I should throw the cocaine away because I might get addicted if I kept doing it. I doubted If I should throw it away or not because I may want to do some later or on the next days. Eventually I threw it down the sink and smoked a bowl to counter the “crash”. 

The next day I regretted throwing the cocaine away as I wished I had some and I still do, so that I’m tempting myself to buy again.

I made a rule when I first started using , that I wouldn’t use before 7pm , this became my biggest downfall as I associate the clock ticking 7pm as ‘line time’

I want to help him get off of it, he tells me he wants to get off of it, but I don’t really think he’s doing anything to make that move.. understandably as that’s what addiction is.. 

I just don’t know how to help him. I can’t physically go do things with him to keep him sober because I just moved across the US, and even when I was there, he still always found a way to get his fix.

I really care about him, we go so far back and he’s been there for me even in his worst moments, he isn’t a bad person at all and I want to help him so badly. He’s genuinely a sweet guy but he’s just so stuck..

Addiction seems to be a redirection of willpower,8,llfc8f,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/llfc8f/addiction_seems_to_be_a_redirection_of_willpower/,5,"One conventional narrative seems to be that addictions require willpower to quit.

My own experience is more like addictions are maladaptive redirections of willpower. Coping isn't simply about things being bad. When things are bad, that can be used as motivation to make things better. However, it can also be used as motivation to do other unrelated and potentially useless or harmful things to try to feel better.

The narrative about powerlessness over addiction also seems weird to me. Instead the root seems to be ""things are bad, but I feel powerless in making things better, so I'll just do something to feel better instead"". This can be a learned helplessness trauma, creating the impression of powerlessness even where there are ways to make things better. The habit of soothing emotions in addictive ways can help that powerlessness impression to continue.

Healing seems to be about directing willpower in more useful ways.",1613543170

I was open to emotional abuse and a form of neglect from this one parent. Despite the other parent loving me, I feel like all the attention was constantly on the addict parent. Holidays and any social events were absolutely exhausting as I knew how they would end. Usually It would require us taking care of the addict parent instead of us enjoying ourselves. Even though for me alcoholism was a daily occurrence and some people knew, I still felt I could never speak about this with any of my friends. It just couldn’t slip through my mouth at all. On top of that being foreign made me the weird kid that nobody liked, so my circle of friends was limited to about 2 people. As I became a teenager (about 15 Years old), with all my buzzing hormones; still living with addict, I felt that since the adults weren’t exactly emotionally stable; one being exceptionally irresponsible, that I should take on the role of the strong emotionally mature one. Even though the addict parent is long sober now, I still feel like I missed out on a lot and grew up faster than other kids.

GREAT Webinar on Shame and Stigma as Barriers to Recovery,2,lljpzu,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lljpzu/great_webinar_on_shame_and_stigma_as_barriers_to/,0,"Webinar by Sammer Elkhateeb

&#x200B;

Shame is so pervasive in our culture that many of us have difficulty recognizing it. It expresses itself in a variety of ways that often have nothing to do with substance use. Stigma has a way of cozying up to shame, and often times this stigma comes less from the outside world and more from the way in which we view ourselves. The internal stigma: what we think we’re capable of, who we are, and how we view ourselves evolves slowly. Stigma is often the last thing to go.

I kinda need help if anyone can.

This shit is making me vomit. I have this type of character that is a mix of curiosity. Likeness of danger and of forbidden things. I am and addict of porns.


 Despite having everything alright in life. Family gf etc. When i started living with my gf i nearly removed all porn activity. This last few months when second wave of quarantine hit. We both had to go to our families. I started the habit again.

Problem is as i mentioned before. I have a thing for the forbidden feeling.  Even if i dont like a subject only the feel of guilt etc will make me open it. 

My first habit was to go for incest porn. Its getting pretty normal nowadays. And i can honestly say that if you mute the audio on certain videos or watch it without context is bettwe than a lot of porns. Because its   close to everyday sex. Not 30 cm dicks and a shiiton of silicon. Anyhow enough about this.

As i said after i got back. Due to stress of not having gf near. Getting crossed by some really bad ppl at work which made me stay nearly 1 year jobless. Then starting again ans same history. Which made me think even leaving my profession and starting anything but it. Despite being my passion.


I picked up some weird fetish for the forbidden fruit. Which went progressively worse. From fake incest to real incest. To hentai loli to real jb, loli call it what you want. 

Its just images but im fucked up internally. I dont find them exciting. Just the sheer adrenaline of browsing on illegal content. I watch the wall instead of phone cos its really disturbing. But still you get to see a glimpse . Its messing with my head up. Its plainly disgusting. Even more i risk destroying all my life if people find out. 

My friends, my gf. Etc...

Its not something i can talk to her. Idk im very afraid to ask for her help. I dont want to get seen with different eye. Not when im not. 

She is a person that when little around 5 or 6 nearly got raped by a pedo. And has had PTSD ever since. Only the  relationship with me has made her see less nightmares. With passing of time.
What would she think. 


Even i on age 7 have fallen prey of such attacks. I remember vividly some dude around 30s 40s telling me to check the door locker of his appartment if its closed.  With my naivity i went there.  Checked started to get back at stairs. When i get confronted by him. It was dark no lights. I remember him taking my hand. Rubing it somewhere. I think it definitely was the pubes. And made noises oh do you like it. Its so good. I felt uncomfortable.  Tried to run of and he did let me go away. Maybe fear of getting caught who knows. I go tell my dad and its the first and the only time ive seen his gentle soul. With i will kill someone eyes. Dead set. We went back at the place but he was gone. I haven't  had nightmares or such i am kinda like my dad. A gentle soul. Even mentioned to me friends casually  i got attacked by a pedo. At the same day. 

I am good. I know myself. I just want to make myself stop doing stupid things like browsing where i should not.  Can someone help. Thanks very much if you read it",1613549774
Family makes it harder to quit,3,ll9ore,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ll9ore/family_makes_it_harder_to_quit/,1,I ended up getting really into weed kind of way more then I expected. First it started with 2 joints a week the worst it had gotten was smoking an eighth a day and maybe .5 of wax. But non the less I cut out the wax then I cut out the blunts and then I cut out the joints. Today is my second day sober but the issue here is whenever me and my mother get into any kind of altercation it tends to go a little like this. (Me) asking a simple question that irritated my mother. (Mom) I don’t want to hear it why don’t you just go outside and smoke your weed. The thing is little does she know that I quit because weed wasn’t doing it anymore my tolerance grew so high that i was feeling the desire for possibly exploring new drugs. So here I am struggling so much to quit and finally did it but now this is the kind of shit I have to hear. Any advice? Ps I’m 21 and started smoking weed heavy in March 2020 and since then I’ve tried to quit three times.,1613527589
My story is simple; there was a war and I lost.,6,ll5rnj,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ll5rnj/my_story_is_simple_there_was_a_war_and_i_lost/,6," My story is simple; there was a war and I lost.  The bad news is, I lost and hurt a lot of people along the way. The good news is I lost but I survived! By tapping into a real power greater than myself, the grace, and a wonderful spiritual fellowship, I’ve reconciled my life to a place better than I could ever imagine - and the truth is, the journey has just begun.  Ive heard speakers talk about having a spiritual awakening similar to the 9th step promises after taking their first drink. A similar thing happened to me. I was finally free - free from the weight of me and the fear of everyone else. Mad and pissed off at God, I spent years using drugs and alcohol as a counterfeit spiritual experience; the consequences started mounting.  Unfortunately if you're a real addict like me, consequences won’t keep you sober. I still hated being me and was afraid of everyone else. It took 16 years of treatment centers, therapists, coaches and wrestling with God and myself to finally come to what I call a ""True Bottom"". That’s when you come to realize your complete lack of power, control and connection. With God, myself and others, I was lost. I had LOST.  In that moment of defeat, I came to a place of utter surrender and God met me in a powerful way. I was set free. A meeting paradigm of thinking and lifting began to take shape in my heart and my mind. Through working a rigorous spiritual program, reckless abandonment to God, a radically generous lifestyle of serving others and fearless vulnerability, I’ve been clean and sober since Valentine’s Day 2020. God's love is untamed, as He picked the best sobriety date ever for me. Yeah there was a war, and initially I lost, but now I’ve gained everything - and more.  Be brave! Freedom is available.  May God bless you and keep you until then.",1613516996

A bit of background, I was a very severe IV drug user for many years, with cocaine as my drug of choice but once I became addicted to the needle, it was anything I could find just to inject.

Due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to temporarily move into a shelter until a friend returns so I have somewhere else to go.

At the shelter, while outside having a puff of my vape someone brought out the cocaine, and all clean equipment. 

And I said ""you know what? Fuck it, once won't kill me""

I haven't used since that one shot, but I left the shelter and have been drinking so heavily that I'm now in withdrawal just from that.

I'm alone, and I'm scared to death, I don't know what to do or who to turn to on a personal level.

It just helps to finally get this out, thank you to anyone that reads this. This got so out of hand, so fast",1613442644

"Realistically, how helpful is this?",1,ll8pu0,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ll8pu0/realistically_how_helpful_is_this/,2,"I just wanted to get input from others who are recovering addicts, supporters, or both.

I'm a recovering alcoholic and prescription pill abuser. Getting clean was difficult and I still see a substance abuse counsellor for relapse prevention sometimes when I'm struggling, but for me I found it helpful that a friend made me ""accountable"".

He didn't specifically ask if I'd been partaking, he'd just ask if I'd been travelling okay.

I have a friend that most people have written off. He's a heavy drinker and is drunk more often than not, and he's an aggressive drunk.

After I had to basically beat him up to stop him attacking someone with a hammer while drunk, he came to respect me and somehow came to the conclusion that I'm now a sister to him. He's an indigenous Australian and his culture takes such connections very seriously, which puts me in a position to be able to help him.

I've seen who this guy can be when sober, and he's a great guy, and that's how the friendship began.

Which leads me to my question...

Yesterday I bumped into him. I greeted him and did that handshake that's half a hug. He looked a bit down so I asked if he'd been keeping his nose clean  and he sort of mumbled a reply. So I reminded him I'm there for him and he mumbled another reply and wandered off.

I got in my car and talked to Mum for a few, then headed home. Two streets away I saw him leaving a house and shoving something in his pocket as he left.

It might not be what it looked like but around here it's likely that it is. He gets depressed because most people have written him off and I think he might have moved beyond alcohol.

He wants to get sober and has been clean for up to two months at a time before relapsing, and I'm just wondering if I'm helping him be accountable by being a friend to him or whether it's not going to be any help at all. He's battled addiction far longer than I ever did.

I'm not considering walking away, too many people have done that to him already. I'm just wondering whether casual contact is enougb or whether I should get in his face a bit more by ""happening to walk past with my dog"".

He's not the type who likes people to drop in, he's kind of reclusive, so I don't want to invade his space.

Or is this something he's got to work oug on his own?",1613524945

We met years ago. When I was just a kid. And I admit we did have fun at first. But it wasn’t long until things got ugly. My family noticed it first, and soon I realized too I had a devil by my side.

Some say I was born with you there. Others say that getting rid of you was as simple as not picking up the phone or showing up at your door. All I know is I have tried one hundred times to kill you, but in the end you won and damn near buried me.

Looking back, you’ve been the cause of a lot of wasted years, a lot of tears. And too much disappointment to begin to count. 

Relationships have been sabotaged. My physical health deteriorated. You fucked up my career, my education, my motivation and my mental state. 

The amount of money I have spent on you makes me absolutely sick. 

I was never able to live up to my full potential having you around. So now it’s time you go. 

In my heart I always knew I would thrive without you by my side. 

I do not know what the future will bring. But I know won’t be spent with you. 

I’m going to trade you for co-workers that respect me, a family that loves me, friends who appreciate me, and a nice girl by my side.

Whatever this life brings I will take it on clear-eyed and sober.

Is it normal for addicts to change in a negative way when they get clean?,3,lkiaf1,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lkiaf1/is_it_normal_for_addicts_to_change_in_a_negative/,8,"Long story short, my ex and I were together for 4 years and broke up almost a year ago so he could get clean from his coke addiction. We got along so well and were best friends. In the last year, he's apparently been clean but hasn't wanted to be back together. He'll come back to me and pursue things for a couple weeks, then leaves again.

This time I thought would be different. I had him blocked for 2 months so he had no access to me. On January 16th he contacted my mother to get a hold of me. He told me that he just needed to accept that he loved me, wanted me to move in soon, and wanted to get married.

Within a week he changed. You'd think he'd be kissing my feet, but instead he became so disrespectful by making comments about being single and making me feel like I was a bother to his life. I came back to the relationship with a clean slate, but HE started bringing up the past and even shamed me for forgiving him.

He even had the audacity to tell me that I only want to be with him now that he has his life together. Do you know how that feels when I've stuck by him through EVERYTHING and that was the exact point of the break up?

It's almost like he became delusional. He literally changed to a different man before my eyes. He used to be so sweet and treated me like a princess. Now he's acting like a narcissistic douche.

It came to a head last week when he straight up IGNORED me all week. I really couldn't get him to talk to me so I texted him telling him I was thinking of ending it and it would be over for good this time. No response. So I blocked him on everything.

I feel so sad. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that this is how he acts now that he's clean. I literally waited a year of my life to be with him again and for us to have our happily ever after, but instead he's turned into a selfish douche bag. I would never date him now if I was just meeting him for the first time.

I'm frustrated with myself that I let this go on for so long, and I feel immense grief for the life that I thought I was going to have with him. I'm sad that the old him is basically non-existent at this point. Is it normal for addicts to change in such a negative way after getting clean? I just don't understand what happened.",1613438629

Minor problem with my perscribed meds...,1,lkm20r,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lkm20r/minor_problem_with_my_perscribed_meds/,1,"Hello,  
I'm having a problem with my Ritalin perscription and hope someone here can give me some advice. Over on r/ADHD people seem rather hostile about this topic...  
A few months back I was diagnosed with ADHD (29yo), and got perscribed Ritalin 10mg Pills.  
Dose for a day should be either 5/5/0, 5/5/5, 10/10/0 or 10/10/5.  
I know I have a somewhat addictive personality, or rather I have trouble stopping once I get going.  
During the last 15 years I've had different kinds of Drugs like MDMD, Speed, Coke, Weed and ofc Booze.

  
My personal situation is not very good, and hasn't been for the last 15 years.  
I was very happy about my perscription and diagnosis because it had helped me at first but now I feel like its making everything worse.  
I didn't get any support after getting handed my Meds (basically just a: Here is Ritalin, don't take too much, thnx bye) and after a while (last 5-6 Weeks) I started taking more and more than I should.  At first I went up to 40mg a day, then 50-60... I almost got into trouble because I ran out early and had to cover a week without an lying that I had enough for 2 weeks left.  
I told myself I would stop this behaviour when I got my next load.

I went to the pharmacy last monday, 7 days ago, and already downed 46 of the 200 pills... Thats about 70mg a day...  
The first two days where rough, I had about 9 over the course of about 12 hours.  
On Wednesday I had an appointment with a Psychologist/Docter I had organized and managed to only take 10mg up to then. I told her about my problem but kinda didn't go into too much detail because I was worried about her reaction and she said I should really try to stay on dosage.  
With my newfound confidence I strode home and by the time I went to bed I had had another 6 pills...  
The next day I got down to 60mg. Friday down to 55mg.

  
Today at 10am I wanted to get it right and started with just 10mg and an hour later I was at 20 again.  
The day is almost over and I'm sitting at 80 again...  


Am I addicted? Do you think I can get back down to my original dosage?  
Does anyone think my original dosage will still work?  
I am so worried and I dont know what to do.  
I'm not taking it for a high, otherwise I would be taking a bunch at once and not just keep smacking myself with another 5 or 10 mg every 1-1.5 hours... I think it's just stress from everything beeing horrible and me somehow hoping that shoveling more in will somehow help...  


I appologize for the long text and any mistakes it might contain.  


I hope someone can give me some hope or I don't know, just say something that may help.  


Thank you.",1613448917

The truth hurts and you don’t want to hear it, I’m still an addict; alcohol, porn, sex, gambling, video games, even still drugs. My addictions are endless, I fight with my head everyday. I would love to just go back to smoking the meth pipe because I didn’t care, I had no shame, I was to high to care. I would love to go back to taking 3 Xans an hour just to make me feel acceptable in society but in reality it was just blinding me to the judgement that made me the way I am today.

Crystal meth. Relapse after relapse after relapse. All I want is to be free.,6,lk99xa,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lk99xa/crystal_meth_relapse_after_relapse_after_relapse/,18,"I've posted in this forum many times before pleading for help with this. But here I am again, looking for any words of advice that might change the way I think. 

I've used crystal meth daily for more than 3 years now. My addiction really spun out of control once I started administering it by injection (>6 months ago). I have been using a gram every 2-3 days. I tell myself everytime I buy a bag that this is the last time. I research day in and day out about what it's doing inside my brain and look for methods of recovery from it. But once I run out of the stuff it's like a demonic energy takes over me almost right away and my mind becomes a storm of fear, anxiety, and self manipulation. I act on impulses immediately all the time. I know what I should be doing, but I can never act upon it or think with reason once I enter this state.

I have been on a hard bender since Christmas. Prior to it I had made it almost 20 days clean and I actually remember feeling better and the chaos in my life had really gotten more quiet. I have been skipping my support group meetings out of shamefulness and things are starting to darken again. 

I really just cannot live this way anymore, I've gotten myself way too deep in this though. I feel helpless at this point. I really want to think that I do not need rehab and can overcome this without but damn I just don't really know anymore. I want to create a written recovery plan with realistic goals that are achievable. I promise myself I will try my hardest to focus on it with first priority.

If any ex addicts or anyone at all has any stories of what got them free, please 🥺 I want this so much, I know that my thinking must be changed, but how?",1613406255

Please help a struggling addict!!!,2,lk9fgp,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lk9fgp/please_help_a_struggling_addict/,31,"🆘Please help🆘

just a post to get some advice of my good ol fellow junkies. so to start off ive been using benzos and opiated for 5years straight. ( for the information, i just turned 18 so im pretty young )I went to a detox in last year, was there for 10weeks. My tolerance was that high that it took 8 weeks to get off benzos and opiates. After going trough that missery i said to myself: Now i am really done with it! ( yeah sure...) so full of confidience, feeling better, sitting on my pink cloud thinking i can do everything now im clean. I come up with the amazing idea that while im still in a clinic when i turn 18 i can still use that last time to close this chapter. 

Long story short got a urine screening they caught me with almost everything possible and sent me away to another rehab in africa for 2months. I am homeless, broke and broken at this point, already failed in my eyes with the relapse and this is my last change, last one to fix the trust and pain with my loved ones. Here i really try my best, follow the program, try to change my people places things and thinking patterns etc.
I attend to meeting, do my stepwork and i try to talk to people with a long clean time to see what life is like.

Okayyy, Here is the part i want advice for:

As im sitting here i am in a safehouse with screenings every week. I am on anti depressants and i start feeling better time by time. Problem is lack of motivation. im already sick and tired of life and it didnt even start yet. So i am here sober for 4months now trying to find a life worth living, and if i trust the people around me life will get better, but for me it doesnt the only thing that changed is that now i can feel things again ive always pushes away.

I gave up last night and ordered benzos, opiates and smoked some cannabis yesterday night.

i can start counting again with clean time but i feel just like giving up. Because why working for a life that i am not going to like. Please help me i am desperate and dont know what i can do.

Should I just accept what i did and use again(what i want) and try to quit when i am older or just try again and again untill i see things slightly changing and hoping that that will bring external factors in my life that will motivate me?


I really hope someone can help me or just lift me up or give advice

I was once sober for a number of years, but I relapsed. Currently, I've been sober 3 months now.

First, some background information: I am male, 19 years old and live in Germany (where cannabis is not even allowed. 

My cannabis addiction started in March of last year. 
I did not get the desired school leaving certificate, I did not get a job and sat at home because of the first one  Lockdown. 
So I thought to myself: What do I have to lose? 
So I smoked all the time from morning to evening. This was where the first addiction developed. 
When I got a good school course in August last year, I had to  getting rid of cannabis addiction. 
In trying to escape that addiction I created an even bigger one. 
I tried building joints with more tobacco and less cannabis. And it helped against the canabis. Unfortunately, I became addicted to nicotine. 
I did not question my nicotine use.  But at least the nicotine is not that negative for everyday tasks, so I ignored the addiction, until 2 weeks ago, thats when I realized  how bad it is for me and how little it gets me. 

So I smoked the last cigarette and didn't buy any new ones.  
It was very hard, especially the 2nd and 3rd day.  But it was manageable and I'm happier and richer than ever.",1613341722
I relapsed after 15 months clean,2,lk1qsn,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lk1qsn/i_relapsed_after_15_months_clean/,12,"Yesterday was a traumatic triggering day for me. Yesterday, I was assaulted by a security officer in a Home Depot parking lot. To give you all some context: back in 2018 I was brutally raped and assaulted and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through. To the point of almost taking my life. I went down a very bad path cause I didn’t know how to cope. Attempted suicide, turned to drugs, self harm, and more. I was put on SSRIs and anxiety medication. I was admitted to the psych word for a 72 hour hold for slicing my wrist cause of the assault.  I was admitted again for severe panic attacks. And I  was 5150d for a psychotic break down shortly after. It’s been a rough couple of years. After getting myself to NA and therapy and a psychiatrist, i  eventually clawed my way out of this dark hole and got myself together. I went back to school, was able to get off my medication, and just celebrated 15 months sober. The night terrors were finally going away and I hadn’t had a panic attack.... 

Until yesterday, all the years I’ve worked towards getting better gone in a matter of minutes. A security lady punched me in the face and threw her body on top of mine. I’m a small girl. I’m 5’2 and 120 lbs. she must have had 80 lbs on me. And violently attacked me after berating me for “rolling” through a stop sign and almost hitting her. I kept apologizing. I was with my dad and we were talking and I must of been distracted while talking to him but he swears I didn’t roll through the stop sign and she wasn’t anywhere near us in the intersection. She wouldn’t stop yelling in my face and her breath smelled like weed and eventually shoving me to the floor and punching me in the head. I was triggered. Last time someone was on top of me they were punching my face in and raping me violently. When she was pulled off me I felt like I was right back at the night of my rape. 

I relapsed last night and today. I’ve had the worst panic attacks and thoughts. I’ve already called my therapists and I’m going to go to a meeting tomorrow. I feel so damaged, hopeless and helpless. 

Why do people hurt me. Will I ever get through this trauma? Did I deserve to get attacked for said “rolling” through a stop sign? 

Get this... she wasn’t even Home Depot’s security guard. She was the strip malls. Not Home Depot’s. She didn’t even have any right to be in their parking lot. After the incident the security company allowed her to go back to work and continue her shift. 
Some witness told the cops that he was there two weeks ago with her wife and she did the same thing to her. 

Can we please be nicer to people. I bet if she had known that I’m a rape survivor she probably wouldn’t have hit me. You never know what someone is going through or has been through.",1613378998

Gambling issues (and more)....,1,lk1v25,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lk1v25/gambling_issues_and_more/,0,"Posted it already in r/problemgambling but I guess I'm going to share it here also, sorry if I broke any of the subreddit rules.  


I will try to explain this in a way that is short and simple and yet detailed so I'm not sure how long it's going to be really....  


So let's start it off, I have gambling issues and I'm.. reformed gambler which went back to gambling. Basically it started off innocent, literally harmless bet of quite literally few cents no harm or anything.. but it went into a habit.. eventually I realized that the only way to win ""big"" is to bet more money and that's what I've done... (now we're talking about few dollars, again nothing serious).. the issue is that it went into a habit...  


Before I was even aware of it, dollar by dollar it went into few hundred of dollars.. (and eventually it went more and more).... - now to note it, I was strictly spending my own money whatever if it was given to me or I earned it or something else it was never loan or anything like that...  


Eventually my parents figured out that I'm gambling (which is quite ironic considering the fact that they were watching me gamble (online gambling) infront of them for years and completly ignored it and went mad once they realized I'm spending real money).. so we had argument over that and I have agreed to stop it under one condition (which I'm going to mention soon) and I've stopped it, and went even a step further and literally cut anything what could trigger that gambling (what I was able to control) from my life.. and I was reformed for a while, probably over a year.. and well, I've started making daily spins (free daily spins) in one singleplayer game not related to real life or anything whatsoever and it slowly but surely ""triggered"" my gambling addiction back (triggered is a lie, it only unlocked something what I have locked in myself for completly different reasons).. and here I am again with the issues...   


Now, to give a bit of a perspective of what's going on actually... it's not a matter of me gambling for the sake of gambling, the issue is that I have no respect for money whatsoever because I was raised in that way.. living in a very toxic family which thought that money can be replaced with everything, save every cent and penny which you can but at the same time be cocky, drive luxurious vehicles and make sure that everyone else is jelaous of you... and I'm not like that.. I just can't pretend to be something what I'm not.. and it's even more complicated.. basically I'm not in the position to do anything because looking at one point I really need to move away and looking from another I can't because I'm in university and I'm without a job (looking for one) and while they're supposed to still finance me (by the law) through the time while I'm studying, I can't exactly say that they don't but they're again counting every cent and that's what's just driving me crazy and forcing me to gamble and lose respect for the money.. ""oh you need new shirt/jeans? Why the hell did you tear apart old one?"" - well maybe it got torn apart on it's own because it's old damn it? And well, the thing is that toxic behavior was going on way before I started gambling (or for a matter of fact before they had any idea of that whatsoever) and the thing is I just got to the point where I got sick of their money and ""tried getting some of my own"" (by gambling.. which didn't work out too well)...   


How I'm standing right now? Well.. nothing really changed, I'm not in debts or anything like that to worry about but the issue is (as stated) that I don't have any respect for the money... like, let's say I take some money for the coffee or to go out - person didn't show up or cancelled? Throw that money into gambling straight away... and the thing is.. while those are mostly small ammounts if I was to save up the money which I lost those would be some serious figures (which I don't really want to talk about)... and those figures are getting higher and higher because I keep doing the same thing over and over again....  


...another well at the same time issue and solution, honestly saying I don't have motivation to do anything really.. due to situation mentioned above (at home, not gambling) I'm pretty much at breaking point every day and it's been going on for years, so while I am holding it together (not really) at the same time I don't really see a reason in doing anything.. whatever if it's studying, going out, finding a hobby or something... not that I don't want to, I do but like studying for example.. like if I don't study and I don't have any expectations I fail exam and I know why I failed it, but if I do study and fail then.. it's actually a huge dissapointment and I just don't know what to do at that point..   


If someone has some follow up questions please do ask them, but also please do not answer with some hotline number for gambling issues or something like that.. that's why I'm posting it here...",1613379391

Why is it so easy to tell a random stranger we have an addiction compared to our own family?,4,ljjftn,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ljjftn/why_is_it_so_easy_to_tell_a_random_stranger_we/,4,"I know what you are thinking. It's because our family expects the best of us and loves us. But if I were to tell the random guy at the grocery store I am an addict he would say ""I'm praying for you, and I hope things get better for you."" But if I was to tell my mom she would be like ""how could you?"" ""When are you ever going to learn."" Or worse ""I disown you.""

I just don't understand. I know parents have tough love for their children, but hell if you have an adult child suffering treat them like one. Not like a person who brought shame unpon the family. We need you to love us. Not tell us how disappointed you are. 

If some random person could reach out and say positive things for us instead of beating us down why can't our own family do the same? I bet you there are people who refused to go to treatment because they are scared of what their own family will say to them. 

Come on parents, we are people too. We know you love us. It's time you look at us like a stranger would and stop tearing us down!!",1613314262

Just realized I am an addict. Not sure where to go from here..,2,ljjzl5,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ljjzl5/just_realized_i_am_an_addict_not_sure_where_to_go/,1,"Let me elaborate a bit..

I was addicted to smoking from 11yo until my mid 20s. When I quit that, I was very proud of myself and felt I could do anything.

I still drank though, and though it took me years to realize I had a problem, I did have one from my early 20’s until I landed in the hospital in my early 30’s just a few months before my wedding. Even that and the known damage it did to my body didn’t stop me until I found out that I was going to be a father. I quit right away when I learnt that, and I haven’t drank for 4 years now since then.

But after I stopped drinking, I shopped. Always justifying it as spending money on things that were “useful” etc, but I just kept buying and buying. Luckily I could afford it, but it was nowhere near the responsible thing to do with my money, and I’ve spent tens of thousands when that could’ve been put to much better use. It got to the point where I faced myself on it, and have cut down and really tried mentally talking myself out of the next purchase etc.. but it’s still something I’m struggling with a bit..

And as I make progress on stopping the shopping addiction, the better I do at that, the worse I do with another issue I see developing... emotional eating.

For the past few months I’ve done good spending little to no money buying things, but my eating habits have went out the window and I find myself not just eating out of boredom but also out of despair at times. I really didn’t notice it for a while until I started gaining weight recently, and I’ve been feeling like I *need* to eat this unhealthy junk food just to get through the day.  It’s a very weird and new feeling for me, which is why it took me so long to identify it as emotional eating.  It’s as if the food is regulating my emotions in lieu of other things... and it’s way harder for me to talk myself out of this for some reason, like my body is on auto pilot and I’ll go out of my way to get something sweet/junky into me just to feel “ok”. It’s scary.

So, I realized I’m just an addict. To what? Everything it seems. As soon as I conquer one thing another one pops it’s head... and yes My parents had addiction issues and yes I’ve had l early trauma that I went through therapy for, so I understand how it can be related but... here I am just wondering to myself...

Can it ever really end? Will it ever end? Is it possible? Will I ever get to be the person I really want to be?",1613316647

My (21F) boyfriend (23F) is addicted to cannabis and it ruins our relationship.,5,ljavkm,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ljavkm/my_21f_boyfriend_23f_is_addicted_to_cannabis_and/,11,"I really need to get this off my chest. I'm afraid to talk about this to friends.

First, when I met my boyfriend, I knew he was addicted to cannabis, but it didn't really bother me. The problem now is that he can't have access to cannabis when he wants.

Indeed, when we met, he has just begun to stop to deal cannabis, and has just begun to have a legal job. He said meeting myself has motivated him more to stop to be a dealer : he knew it is the best for him and I said since the beginning that I can't accept to be with a dealer. 

When he was a dealer, he could have access to all the cannabis he ""needed"". Then, with his legal job (15-20h/week I think), he got a lot less money, but it was ok for buying his consommation. Sometimes, at the end of the month, he would ask me 20-30 euros to buy his drug, it was ok since he would refund me next month.

But, in december, his contract ended, so no money anymore. He has find a new work that will star on Tuesday. His parents are poor and know about his consommation, but can't pay for a the drug he needs : he smokes for 20 euros of cannabis in 2-3 days. So, as I am financially ok, he asks me to pay... I think I have spend around 250 euros if not more. It is a lot since I am a student. My parents can give me money if I ask, but I don't want to always enjoy of them.

I use the verb ""need"" since he becomes totally crazy when he doesn't have his cannabis for 1 day or more... he becomes very aggressive, and suicidal. He says cannabis help to calm his mind, since he had a very difficult childhood and traumatic memories. 
So, when I can't help him he always talk about become a dealer again and leave me so I wouldn't have to deal with him selling drug.

What makes me write espacially tonight ? This afternoon, he asked me if I could help him : but I had no money on me since I have lost my credit card, I have to wait next week to receive it. Then, he canceled our Saint-Valentine's night because he said he would walk around the city to find drug. Finally, he didn't find cannabis. But when he went home he became totally crazy and said it was over between us. Morever, he made me the reproch to not have him given my personal consommation : I had some weed on my pocket (I spoke very occasionnaly on a more therapeutical way)... I didn't gave him since I knew it wouldn't last long enough for him.

I don't know if I am asking for help or whatever, I am just very sad and even if I know he is addicted, I feel like secondary to his cannabis. It is the first guy that really loves me and cares about me, my heart is broken.",1613283935

When I relapsed this time around, there was no warm up period. Almost immediately I was back at my worst. This time around though, my mind wasn’t ready for it and I began experiencing drug endured psychosis without doing large quantities of drugs. I think the time sober and going to the gym every day got me healthy for the first time in my life. So when the drugs were reintroduced, it sent shock waves through my healing brain. The last couple months have been daily use of meth and heroin. I kept telling myself that I wasn’t using very much heroin, but when I stopped, my withdrawals were horrendous. I have been living in denial of how much I have been using. My girlfriend caught me in the act of trying to cop a sack today and took me home empty handed. Like watching a storm roll in from the distance, I started withdrawing from both my drugs of choice. My body and mind were being ripped in different directions. The anxiety is so extreme that I thought I was going to break my fingers from pulling and bending them so much. There was no more down playing how much I have been using when the severity of detoxing makes it obvious. And this is only the beginning of my detox. This is a pointless post but I know there are people out there that get it. Unless you have stated into the abyss and had to fight off the demons, you don’t get the hell that comes with kicking a habit.

I received a lot of love and support and figured I should update you guys now that it's been a few months.

I know a lot of people were warning me that it was going to be extremely difficult for him to quit something like fentanyl cold turkey, but my boyfriend has officially hit 5 months sober today. The first month of sobriety was really tough on him but he hasn't relapsed at all and expressed he feels absolutely no desire to ever use again. He hates it for the way it ruined both his life and his brother's life (his brother got him addicted). He now has a job, his own place, and is working on getting his car back up and running. He once again feels in control of himself and his life.

Thank you everyone for all your advice, in a way this sub and all of the wonderful people here helped me understand his addiction better and helped save my boyfriend's life.

(we had to make sure the house was safe before leaving) that being said we highly doubt anyone was there and his paranoia was taking over which wouldn't surprise me if it came from doing cocaine like a mad man. me and buddy talked for a while after the second call where he claimed again people were at his door. we think its a sign that he need help and bad. now we go to friend 2 this guy does coke like a mad man hes the true addict but he never wants to do it alone and that's when friend 1 gets pulled in (and its bad like that, peer pressure to the max)  during red phases here in our province they both went out to do coke and stay up all night during lockdown and these guys couldn't wait a week till it was over they were ready to risk it all. that action there cost friend 1 to get kicked out of his house. We are at this point today none of their parents know about any of it completely oblivious to it all (doesn't help that friend 1 relationship with his parent is toxic as fuck) we want to give them help bad but we aren't sure what will work or how to go about it. but something needs to happen tho and fast.

I've quit. But will it last? Help.,2,lj608y,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lj608y/ive_quit_but_will_it_last_help/,2,"Hi. I've been off drugs for over a year now. I used drugs for a pretty short period and never got physically addicted since i constantly wanted to try new things. I  mostly did cannabis, MDMA, nitrous, benzos, LSD, 2C-B, cocaine and ketamine. Since i spent about 2-3 weeks on and off per drug during this short period of my life, i never got physically addicted but very psychologically addicted.

I had everything while growing up. Friendly and safe household, good income and nothing to worry about. After a couple years of me moving out and working full time i simply got bored of life and felt unfulfilled. I started hanging out with some old friends i grew up with that were in to drugs and i fell down the rabbit hole.

Towards the end of my drug use i had a mental breakdown caused by mostly feelings of guilt and the depression that i had been trying to keep at bay through self-medicating. I ended up telling my family about my drug use after this breakdown since i just couldn't hide it anymore. The sadness, shock and confusion in their eyes made me quit and i made a promise to them that i would seek help and find the root of my unhappiness instead of self-medicating it.

It's been a hellish year and i've have been diagnosed with social anxiety and ADD and been prescribed Vyvanse for my ADD which is probably the thing that's been chipping away at me my whole life. In theory things should only start improving from here but i'm still struggling a lot.
I still have strong urges to go back to my ""bad"" friend group and do drugs or abuse my medication. I've already abused it twice and knew I would feel horrible afterwards but i still did it. The only thing keeping me somewhat on track is not wanting to disappoint my family and see them like that again but i feel like i am walking a very thin line here.

I realized that i never wanted to quit for my own sake and wellbeing. I quit because i didn't want to hurt the people that matter around me. I just told them what they wanted to hear and letting that be my moral compass. I'm terrified of walking this razor's edge that i won't be able to control myself and do something very stupid and ruin it all again. Can you quit for good by trying to please the people around you or does it need to come from the heart of the individual? It feels like I'm missing a huge chunk of the puzzle and i don't know what to do.",1613269472

I am a drug addict but I keep denying it,3,liy5i9,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/liy5i9/i_am_a_drug_addict_but_i_keep_denying_it/,6,"Hello everyone! I am new to reddit so sorry if this isn’t the right sub reddit to post this on. I’ll start by introducing myself. My name is Daniel, I turned 18 last summer, I am a private pilot and a big time aviation enthusiast.

I don’t really know where to start. I guess ill start from the beginning. About half a year ago or so I began experiencing daily panic attacks, I’ve always been a very anxious person but my anxiety has gotten out of hand. I did seek professional help and was diagnosed with GAD and depression. I was prescribed Ativan and some sort of anti-depressant (I honestly never even bothered to check what the anti depressant is). My panic attacks slowly started going away. I still experience panic attacks, but just not nearly as often, however, my anxiety is worse then it’s ever been, and unfortunately anxiety and depression happen to get along very well, so when anxiety comes along, so does the depression. 

I really hoped the meds would completely get rid of my depression and anxiety but unfortunately that’s not the case with these meds I guess. Being my stupid young self I turned to marijuana in order to cope with my constant anxious thoughts, my constantly racing heart, and my constant panic. I’ve been seeking help and trying so many different things but nothing seems to be working, I just don’t know what other way there is to cope with this. I’d rather be deceased then sober and constantly anxious. I eventually started using weed daily, as soon as I’d wake up, in the afternoon, even at work I would go hit my dab pen in the bathrooms and bring eye drops so no one would notice my bloodshot eyes, I am just constantly seeking ways to leave reality, and when I don’t have weed I find other ways to avoid sobriety. I start to drink, I even take a crap ton of Ativan to try to feel some sort of high, just trying my best to slow down my thoughts. 

I haven’t smoked weed in a couple days now, but even writing this right now I am not fully sober. Not having weed for the past couple days has been a living hell, I just had a panic attack about an hour ago. I had a pretty bad breakdown in the laundry room curled up in a ball. 

The hardest thing though, is hiding all of this from my parents. I know it’s a stupid thing hiding this because I seriously do need professional help, but my parents trust for me is non existent. They’re constantly paranoid, they constantly worry about me, and I know that if I tell them about this they might have a fucking heart attack. I’m really scared to tell anyone, I don’t know what will happen, I don’t even know what the next step is. I want to get better, I want to stop this anxious mindset, I want to stop my horrible habits, I want to be normal but the harder I try the further away I stray from being normal. I’m seriously worried that if I keep going down this path, weed and alcohol won’t be the only thing I’ll be consuming. 

I’m more lost then I’ve ever been, and I’m more anxious then a zebra being chased by a lion. I constantly expect the worse in every situation, I hate myself with a passion, I don’t even think I deserve a place in this world with all the horrible things I’ve done. But all that set aside, I am a drug addict. This is the first time I’m ever saying these words but I am a drug addict and I can’t keep denying it any longer. 

I guess my questions would be...where do I start? How do I seek help? How do I tell my loved ones? What is my next step? What the actual fuck do I even do? 

I’m sorry for putting all this shitty energy out there, I know the world is already full of negative energy and I just keep feeding more and more into it. I appreciate every single one of you who’s taken the time out of there days to read this, you truly are angels.",1613240928

Teetering on the edge of a questionable decision...,1,lj37wq,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lj37wq/teetering_on_the_edge_of_a_questionable_decision/,3,"Hey all. I typically come to this sub to offer support to others. Today I’ve decided to put my ego aside and ask for support. 

Brief background... recovering H addict, it’s been about 7 years since I’ve touched the stuff. I’m approaching a year since I last had a hiccup with some benzos I found. 

For whatever reason I seem to have a spike in vulnerability this time of year. Perhaps it’s the weather, I’m an avid outdoorsman and hate being stuck inside. Maybe I’ve developed an association with February and using..

I don’t have any connections at this point, but I have come up with a plan. I work in an industry that necessitates testing our products in a myriad of chemicals. My plan is/was to get ahold of a chemical that is a precursor to a (fairly) well known street drug. I know that it’s probably a bad idea, but the concept of having something that I could use every once in a while is appealing; it’s been stuck in my head for 3 days now. 

Anyway, I don’t have therapy until Tuesday, so I’m just looking for some support to get me through till then. Thanks for reading 

TLDR: in recovery and seeking support to kill a plan to use before it comes to fruition.",1613261059

Ugh addiction is a disease!,9,lio1if,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lio1if/ugh_addiction_is_a_disease/,3,"I feel like people don’t fully grasp this and it hurts me so much and makes it worse. 

I’m home with my parents rn because of covid I’m not living at college and I’ve had some relapses (and during these I haven’t even done anything that bad like hurt anyone steal crash a car or whatever) j just have stayed to myself mostly but acted high. My mol then shames me for it to no end about how horrible I am and how I’m destroying the family end traumatizing everyone and it’s all my fault and how I’ll never be able to live on my own and I shld just stop using rn and the only reason I don’t stop is bcI’m being selfish.

Now I’m not trying to invalidate her feelings I am well aware I’m fucking up and hurting those around me but she acts like that’s my goal.

And this sends me down a shame spiral where she makes me feel like an awful person so I hate myself even more so I Anna use to escape that feeling. She claims to be so progressive and forward thinking but I feel like she amoung many others view addiction as a choice 

Sure I may have made the choice to pick up but I didn’t choose my body and mind to be addicted to it craving about it thinking abt it 24/7 and even my choice to use in the first place wasn’t because I wanted to party or have fun it was because I wanted to escape my own fucking head

I have ptsd from a few rapes as a young teen and early adult last one being abt a year ago and whenever I bring this up to my mom abt using to escape my past that plays over and over again in my head every second she just says that happened a year ago and that’s a dumb excuse for your continued use now

I have no support system I have like 2 friends, and trust me I do take accountability for my drug use I am well aware the role I play in my self destruction. I may be wrong but I feel like that’s just a piece of the puzzle.

I feel like I’m stuck in a never ending shame cycle with no love or support. I know so many people have it much worse than me and I’m sorry. I really just wish I was dead than I cld break free of this fucking cycle bc the guilt and shame are fucking overbearing",1613202270

I can and have gone days, even half a year, without it so quitting isn't the issue.  Though, it really helps me focus on my studies and gives me the concentration to cope with my thoughts when I have anxiety.  I guess you could say it does for me what coffee does for most people, but caffeine is too stimulating for me.  I've tried weed and CBD, but it just doesn't give me the effect I'm looking for.  

The health risks of vaping worry me, and I'm looking for a replacement, something that gives me similar stimulation.  Any ideas?  Anything would help.

Interesting how addiction reveals how broken my brain is.,17,lify0a,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lify0a/interesting_how_addiction_reveals_how_broken_my/,5,"I'm addicted to stimulants. What makes this so difficult is that I have ADHD and stimulants are the most successful treatment for me. Without my medication, I crawl through life in a fog. I was also at risk for addiction since my father is an addict and my mother used to be an addict (she sobered up years ago, passed in 2019 due to unrelated reasons). 

I started stims in highschool for ADHD and they were the best thing to happen to me. I had a lot of side effects, but it made me so productive and astute I didn't want to go back. I was responsible with my medication during this time. I also took the suggested breaks.

It all went downhill when I got into college. I stopped taking breaks, because I wanted to feel what I felt on the medication all the time. My tolerance went through the roof. I was no longer as good as a student as I was in highschool and it drove me mad. I upped my doses, I switched medications. 

Somewhere, more recently, I lost control. I repeatedly blew through my medication despite telling myself that I won't. It's so aggravatingly simple. Just take one pill a day like I'm supposed to. Easy as that. So I do that. Then take another pill a couple of hours later, sometimes two... knowing I shouldn't. Like I'm broken.

It got so bad I blew through 30 pills in a week and a half and finally fessed up to my dad what was going on. He now keeps my medication in a safe and gives me one pill a day. After a month of this, I asked for them back, just to see if I can be normal... and failed, so they're back in the safe. 

I just feel like I'm utterly made wrong. I don't know why I can't just do the smarter thing. I'm an otherwise intelligent and bright person. I should know better. I should be better. But I'm not.",1613179786
Addiction is so interesting.,9,liickd,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/liickd/addiction_is_so_interesting/,2,"I find addiction so interesting and love reading about peoples stories and what is happening inside the brain and of course the psyche of an addict. It's fascinating how differently people are affected.

Personally I have a history of disordered eating and sugar addiction(/Binge-eating). I'm sure that must sound ridiculous to some people but it's real. I can eat like a pound of chocolate/jar of nutella/cookies etc at once and never get nauseous while eating. Rather I crave it and have to make a conscious choice to NOT binge on sweets every day. Multiple times or often all day long. Obviously I often fail and was even bulimic for a period. It's the best and fastest dopamine rush for me, but I'll feel sick afterwards, gain weight and spend the rest of the day in bed in a what I call ""diabetic coma"". So I really want to stop but havent been able to so far...

After all that I have researched, I'm pretty sure I would have gotten addicted to Cocaine or pills if I'd ever gotten the opportunity. Luckily I was never introducted to drugs like that when I was younger and now I'm educated enough not to try. I have tried Marijuana a few times though and it was really boring to me and I stopped. In general I am a calm/down person and I bet ""uppers"" like Adderall would get me hooked instead.

Anyway, despite having no control or limit when it comes to eating, my brain functions perfectly fine with alcohol. I will have a drink with friends or a glass of wine with my boyfriend for dinner, but I stop naturally when I get slightly tipsy. The alcohol just TASTES so bad from that point on and I lose interest.

It's just so strange how you can have control over one thing, but cant gain it over another one. How some people get extremely addicted to alcohol, while others dont. Or how some people can microdose coke for ages and others spiral into heavy addiction after trying once.

"Been using Fentanyl for 4 years. I have a plan to stop soon, but I'm at a point where I don't even know that I believe it'll last. IDK if I even care.",6,lie3a4,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lie3a4/been_using_fentanyl_for_4_years_i_have_a_plan_to/,19,"I like the money I'd have if I didn't use. I liked the amazing job that I lost. I liked the car I had that I had just finished paying off. I love my SO, who doesn't use and is one of the only people that knows that I use Opiates. Two of my friends know but they think I've been sober for over a year. No one in my family knows, and I also like that.     


I still have enough money for bills and rent. I am currently collecting unemployment from the job I lost. I used the money from the car I totaled (plus 3000 more) to buy the same car, except 3 years newer and with 40% less miles. My SO is still with me and wants to help me get clean (again). My friends are awesome and trust me. My family couldn't even begin to imagine how much I've used.   


I haven't really had consequences. Not really. I lost my job, but for now I'm making a similar amount of money from unemployment. I also get monthly disability pay for being a disabled veteran (I'm physically fine, it's basically anxiety issues). I've also been supplementing my income by taking advantage of other peoples addiction - playing poker. I'm playing a lot now that I don't have my job, and I'm confident in paying against any players at the lowest stakes (60$ minimum / 300$ maximum buy in) but I do seek out the weakest and drunkest competition.     


I snort my fentanyl and that's always how I've used it. The last time I got clean I really thought it was going to hold. I made it 5 months and I felt good. I pretty much use for maintenance at this point, and the only time I get a really good feeling from using is when I sleep. If I sleep 8+ hours I wake up feeling like crap, and those first lines of the day – my morning coffee sort of – make me feel amazing. That might not be the most accurate way to word that. I don't actually feel amazing, I feel amazing compared to how I felt before I used. The contrast is what makes it seem so great.   


I've gotten sober plenty of times and I know I can again, but I lost the confidence that I used to have that I would stop and stay stopped. But I don't even feel like I'm getting high at this point. I feel no better then I felt when I had been sober for a few months. When I'm sober for a few months, I know that if I use then I will actually get a real high out of it. That's the only reason that resembles logic I can come up with for why I go back to using. I work pretty hard to stop people from knowing I use and if you asked me I would honestly say I would prefer being sober. This is not sustainable long term. It's sustainable only for the rest of my life, which I know will fall apart completely at some point. I have never overdosed, but that streak could end at any time.     


I feel like I haven't had consequences and I've let myself be a baby about it all. If I've been sober for some time and I feel like using I just do it. Why not? So dumb!   


I have about 30 strips/pills of suboxone and I'm going to pick up more. I plan to stop when I run out, which should be in a bit over a week. When I stop I usually sleep for like a day. I'll sleep as long as I can, then toss and turn for as long as I can, then wait a while more and start taking subs. I've found I need about 24 Mgs for the first 7-14 days, and I try to take it as spread out as I can. The less I take the easier it is to stop taking (this has been my experience). Once I can start taking less I can cut down to zero pretty quickly. Whole process takes about 3-4 weeks iirc, Each time is a bit different.   


I really want this to work. I totaled my car when I was “sober”. My car flipped and ended up on its side. I had no injuries at all. Seat belt gave me a nice little bruise while it was saving my life but other then small scratches that didn't even bleed, I was completely unharmed. I had brown and white on me that at first I put in my sock, then decided to toss into the bushes between the guardrails. I got a warning from the cop – not even a ticket. THANKFULLY no one else/no other cars were involved and I was alone.   


Whenever I go ANYWHERE I have to go off to the bathroom about once an hour. At poker today I thought I had forgot my to-go stash. I remembered I had a backup in my car so I didn't have to leave after playing until I started to feel withdrawal take over. They only have one stall so I have to make several trips sometimes and I can't help but think that someone will catch on. Masks definitely help not show a red or runny nose though, and I try to be careful about making sure I clear the snot from my nose without that being noticed.   


There are so many things – small and big – that I end up having to account for to keep using and not be noticed. I really wanted to pull out my bag with straw and juts snort at the table because fuck it. I've snorted at the urinal a few times when the stall is in use.   


I used to not only do drugs in the bathroom at work, but at my desk too. I stopped snorting while driving. I don't know why though – as strange as that sounds. On my drive home from work I used to snort coke and fen, and I'd turn my laptop on and use my cell to connect to internet, and I'd hop into like a 10$ tournament online. There was absolutely no good reason for this except a kind of fuck it mode where I just didn't care. I was drinking and driving a lot more at that point in time also. So the progress that I've made in the past few years is I stopped snorting while driving, I've greatly cut back on drunk driving and stopped drinking while driving, and I'm no longer playing poker on my laptop or watching YouTube on my phone while driving.     


Sorry for the rant. I never get to be this honest. That's my choice I guess but it's tough to imagine talking like this to anyone that's not being paid to listen. Even when talking to a therapist I would somewhat edit what I say. I'm aware they take notes and from reading their notes (they're available to you), it's caused me to be increasingly aware of what I'm saying

⭐️2.) my aunts always took me and mom shopping every weekend when I was a kid (my one aunt died of the same thing my dad died in 09’) and they live north of us and they have money MONEY WAS NO OBJECT TO THEM! bought me and my mom whatever I wanted or needed if we couldn’t afford it! And I got all the designer hand me downs from my cousin!! 

⭐️3.)I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2015????? 2016ish??????

first time drinking and im nearly 15,1,lik24s,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lik24s/first_time_drinking_and_im_nearly_15/,1," 

Besides having a sip of a drink with the family, I have never had my own glass. And well yeah I fucked up pretty bad. I like this girl a lot and she said she had a glass of wine in her hands. I wanted to seem cool and to fit in with her so I said, ""wait for me to get a drink too"". While my parents were sleeping I ran into a cabinet with some drinks. Like the stupid kid I am, I grab the first thing I see, Buffalo whiskey stuff. I poor a lot into a cup again not knowing the amount. I think it was like as much as a soda can. So I run to my computer, and we have a great time. I don't think she actually had some, cause she seemed pretty normal, and she said she chugged it. I mean maybe she did but my goodness. So I take my first sip, and let me say it was so gross. Burned my throat. I started to down it and I almost barf. We continue to talk and then I feel bad. I'm sweating, and I don't feel good. I decide to call my 18 year old friend who is a pro drinker (at 18). She gives me the sleep on stomach advice. I eventually go to bed at 4am. I wake up at 9 due to class, and I feel awful. Like I can't describe the feeling, as if my head was 10000lbs, and I was in like multiple worlds and time was going fast. A bad headache is another word for it. So, I get through class and here I am now writing this. I feel better now, after I had whiskey, I drank two soda cans, and ate a whole family sized Dorito pack (I'm super bony idk how i did). I am having a strong urge to get more. My family has a big addiction problem, many relatives died from addiction. I am nervous. I don't want people to find out, but I can't continue this.

I remember the first time I ever wanted to try xans. A friend brought them to school the last day of school. I begged everyone around me for $5 and no one would give. I don’t know why I was so hooked even before I’d tried. Even before I smoked or drank or ever did anything I’ve always wanted this for myself. Why?? Everyone always says they never wanted to be this way it just happened. Why did I want this this form of self sabotage and destruction even knowing what addiction has done to my family and how it’s killed so many of my loved ones, I don’t understand. I just wish I felt different, but I don’t, and all I want right now is some fucking fentanyl.",1613152719

I quit abusing drugs and I somehow connected with this young woman that is 3 months sober tomorrow from cocaine and weed.. I just got out of a relationship because I was not happy in it and it only took me being sober for 12 days to learn that my own self worth an happiness is not worth giving up for someone that doesn’t even care about me furthering my life and getting clean! Well, this girl she supports my sobriety 100% unlike my ex that got mad at the mention of it! And I’m there supporting her just as much! Well I don’t know if there is love at first sight and I’m not rushing into this right after breaking up with someone, but I took one look in her eyes and I can’t stop thinking I’m in love.. I feel like I’m floating, in addition to melting and also like I can’t breath right near her like she gives off this air that takes every breath in my lungs away.. I feel butterfly’s from her. I could say with 100% honesty any moment, even second spent with her is  like being in dream but one you can control and it doesn’t end, and every good feeling goes over me like some huge wave. She feels like how the sun glows on your skin on a warm day .. I’m scared to say this but I think I’m in love.. like iv never felt this way not even from a girl I dated for 4 years! This feeling that radiates from her it makes me feel better then any drug I have ever done even times 10. 1 min spent with her is worth more then 100 years of being high. I can’t express this feeling there is no word I could use, I could try writing  a book but that would only scratch the surface of the way she makes me feel. I never thought my life would feel this good yesterday was one of the worst days, but it turned into a dream I never wanted to end. And prob the best day of my whole life..
I’m just saying my experience of being sober, I still have withdraws I have not slept a whole bunch the last 2 days. however I talked to her and she said If I wanted to move in with her I could, she said by the time the basement is finished I could move in there and she would also be sharing it with me and I didn’t even have to pay rent, of course I’m going to be paying rent if I end up doing this in the future! I’m 21 years old right now I live with my mom, I have wanted to leave since 18 but never acted on it and now I have an opportunity of a life time in front of me!!

I hate feeling like I can’t fix something or protect her. I also hate that my parent would take the opportunity to vaguely shit talk me.

At the end of the day I am just relieved my sister is seeking help. I don’t care how she got in this situation all I care about is how to fix it. I need whatever advice I can get. I can’t live without her and she can’t keep living like this. I will take literally whatever advice.

Detox - Things to Keep in Mind.,12,lhwk8o,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lhwk8o/detox_things_to_keep_in_mind/,4,"Tomorrow, I begin my journey to recover from my amphetamine (6yrs) and nicotine (2yrs) addictions. I've made a couple of attempts to get clean in the past (made it as long as 4 months sober once), but I always ended up failing because I never anticipated the hell that is addiction withdrawal. I wasn't prepared for the PAWS. I wasn't prepared for the unbearable dopamine deficit. And I wasn't prepared to face the problems and emotions I was using the drugs to mask. 

I truly believe this time will be different because I now understand exactly what I will go through. I can anticipate the thoughts, feelings, and experiences I will encounter on the long, painful journey to becoming the better version of myself.  I made a list of ""things to keep in mind"" which I plan to read over each day. I wanted to share it in here because I... a) want to see if any of you have any input or additions I need to add, and b) believe it could help anyone fighting a similar battle.

1. It's going to be hard, and it will probably continue to get harder for some time. Be tough and be patient. It *will* eventually get easier. 
2. Your productivity will suffer. Your mood will suffer. Don't freak out. This is okay. It is *only temporary*, and it will be worth it in the end. 
3. Be content with the lack of productivity and focus on making it through each day. Work is not important right now. Your social life is not important right now. Detox is the top priority in your life. 
4. You will have thoughts that your life was better with drugs. *It wasn't*. Don't be deceived by these thoughts. It is *because* of the drugs that you are in a dark spot. This is the reason you're quitting.
5. Always remember that freedom is on the other side. Freedom from dependence, freedom from frequent unnecessary spending, and freedom from the masked version of yourself that's hiding the real, great version of yourself. No more needing *this* to do *that*. No more crash. You can be you *all the time*. You can do what you want to do *all the time*.

Thank you for reading and please let me know if you have any thoughts/advice.

My Time In The Methadone Clinic Made Me Realize The Future Is Dead,12,lhs23f,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lhs23f/my_time_in_the_methadone_clinic_made_me_realize/,1,"Disclaimer: I don't condone the use of the word ""junkie"", and am solely using it to reflect the harmful nature and effects of those that label addicts as such. 

What these people, my broken counterparts, and I silently and shamefully have in common are the irrevocable emotional scars that led this plethora of age, gender, race, and background of people together, united for a shared goal—suppression and survival. I waited in line with my people, and no one speaks except to perhaps significant others which were a typical common theme to see there, or to yell at their children they had brought along.I urgently awaited my turn and I could feel my anxiety rise a few notches at my first glance of the tiny cups being doled out. 

It was finally my turn to stand in front of the small bulletproof glass window that connected to the room that the nurses lock themselves in, and doled our drugs out from within. After all, you could never be too careful, they figured, when dealing with us societal outcasts, the walking dead of the living, the broken ones. I gave them my name and the two hundred milligrams of pink liquid life awaited me in a tiny cup no bigger than my pinky, but large enough to be my savior when supplemented with my daily regimen. One gulp down the hatch, and my mind that was previously my enemy was temporarily quelled with the knowledge that in fifteen minutes I could walk back over the train tracks and continue to portray my artificiality without my body betraying me into divulging the horrible truth—at twenty-two years old, I was over a decade into being a stone cold drug addict with an uncontrollable penchant to destroy myself. 

I walked past the league of children whom were statistically doomed to this masochistic lifestyle, and I knew this because I was those children. The adult child of two addicts, statistically doomed still.  

This stigma is simultaneously contributing to the spread of addiction and things will be even worse for those kids than they were for me. We’ve declared a sham “war on drugs,” which like every war, is only being waged for political gain. It’s less a war on drugs, and more a war on us, the people that use them. Those kids will grow up under a veil of shame and secrecy that will mire them deep down into the exact cloak of darkness addiction needs to grow and thrive within. Like me, no one will ever explain to them it’s not their fault, and that there’s a way out, so they’ll never know there’s a way out. Like me, but only worse now with a war waged against them, against their parents who they love and still respect like kids do, they’ll learn they’re worthless. 

They will continue down this path of destruction and recklessness until their kids, and their kids’ kids know they’re worthless earlier and earlier in life until it’s all they know straight out of the womb, and no one will ever tell them they’re wrong. Junkies straight out of the womb and no one will ever tell them anything different. The world will only reinforce their beliefs by waging war against them, these babies and their parents alike, until they’re, we’re, all dead and gone like the world has designed. If you remember, junkies don’t get special treatment. We don’t get any treatment.The same people that fight for these babies to be born are the first people to turn their backs, and I know because I am them, one of those babies, only now grown up. No one has ever told me anything other than that I’ve chosen this life, and if nothing changes, no one will ever tell these children anything different either. I look at these kids and I see a junkie genocide, because I am their future, and I am dead just like they will be without help.

Prostitutes addiction,1,lhwejf,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lhwejf/prostitutes_addiction/,1,"Feeling stupid but i need to share this,  becouse i am concerned with this behavior, acquired in pandemic, due to the issues of isolation and other factors, im addicted to spend money on massage houses where I Live. 

I know this is wrong and I need to change, because I really don't need to pay for sex and I don't think there should be any explanation for this behavior, just need to get it out and put it in perspective.

26 y brazilian male, and I’m going to try to resume the story a little bit, going to talk about what happened recently in the last few years .. 

Been abusing drugs since i was 15, first it was the cigarette, then the alcohol, in an uncontrolled way , then marijuana, and at 19 I knew cocaine, I was using all of these together until I was 24, today I am sober of all of them except alcohol and cigarettes, which I want to stop too. I am educated (architect), tall, in good shape, there is no physical problem in me to notice, but I have always been very shy, and with problems of self esteem, the cigarette made me very social because my friends were also doing it, cocaine made me more alert, confident and better self-esteem at first. Also my father is a complete nascisist and my mother has depression. 

Everything got worse and I only used it because I was really stuck with it, it was five years, from nineteen to twenty-four that were lost, I used it with friends at partes, their houses and usually with other womens too, that during the first two years, after that I was alone in my apartment and used it non-stop and also drank, without anyone with me.

I never dated anyone in my life and I never fell in love either, there must be something wrong there, I always go out with girls, but I never wanted anything serious, although internally I want to change and be someone who can commit to a relationship. I have been sober for two and a half years and lived hell to get off cocaine, quited cold turkey and without anyone's help, only by replacing it by healthy methods like running, meditating, art, sleeping well, eating well, etc. But very depressed due chemical brain imbalance, like dopamine.. I thought to myself that it would not be good to try to go in a relashionship with someone in the first year, due to the unstable emotional issues..

A year ago, with the beginning of this pandemic, I must have spent more than 8k with girls in massage houses, I always do the same thing, which is to ask for a massage, have sex and leave. I don't want to continue doing it, I feel stupid  every time I do it. Think that I have lost the ability to relate to people emotionally but my libido is getting stronger after a year and a half clean (1 year ago), im not addicted to porn or whathever, im just lonely and dont know how the fuck rebuild my life from here.

I relapsed 1 1/2 week ago. Didn't take much, around 0.7 g of heroin, so luckily there isn't any withdrawals or such. But as we all know, when we (I) use, we tell lies. At least I do. It always seems easier to just lie the whole ordeal away, but Christ what a web to get caught up in. One lie just take the other and suddenly it's all just lies. I truly hate myself right now for decieving the few people I still have around me, but honesty isn't my best trait. 

I've been an addict all my life, so lying has just become sort of normal, and I've actually never really felt bad about it before, but after rehab and now trying to stay clean, the shame of lying is just unbearable. I really wish to just tell the true, take this weight of me, but I'm so freakin' scared that the last people in my life will turn away from me, again.

The time between waiting for a new prescription was misery for myself and anyone around me. Lucky for me, I’d become an avid runner during this time (around 2017) and have consistently logged 30-70 miles a week since. But I lost jobs, damaged friendships, and lost my gf of 4 years because of the person it changed me into. It took me years to realize I’d even become addicted to it, was completely oblivious to my behaviors and the selfishness that’d become of me. 
I quit after my relationship ended. I also quit my job and entered a field I found my calling in; teaching and coaching. I began going back to school. I was thriving and I was happy; yet for whatever reason, I went back to and re-lapsed after 5 months. My family moved back home after living across the country for 4 years and I moved in with them to save money and to be with them. My 3 year old nephew, sister, and brother in law moved into the same household too after moving back home. During this time, my irritability has peaked, moods ebb and flow, and I’ve become very detached from everyone. 

The hard part: none of them have a clue about my addiction. And it’s something I’m ashamed of, to tell anybody really. 

Three days ago, I had a light bulb moment in my head appear and realized that this has to end. I got rid of my Adderall, but I knew I would endure a rough road ahead. But I want to stop living a lie and be the “real me”. Not the person this drug turns me into. I know if I go back to it, that I will never be the best version of myself. I know how powerful/positive of a figure and influence I can be in teaching and coaching if I am my true self. That is my motivation as I thoroughly enjoy and get a high from teaching and coaching.

My Life Ended in 6 Months,8,lhde7e,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lhde7e/my_life_ended_in_6_months/,6," 

I'm suffering from extreme social anxiety and have crippling PTSD from an abusive and manipulative relationship. I would like to seek out treatment and see a psychiatrist and therapist but don't have the funds or resources. I'm homeless and can't afford rent, tuition for my education, or groceries. I'm on a housing assistance program waitlist that will take forever because I'm in the Bay Area. I'm supposed to start school this week but can't pay my enrollment fees. I get food stamps but only get $16 a month which is comparable to one meal a month. I have over $20k worth of debt that was racked up within 6 months when I got into a manipulative abusive relationship. I will be dealing with the effects of this relationship for the rest of my life- financially and mentally.

I've been trying to seek out help but have no motivation to do anything. For the first time in my life I can honestly say I have never felt so numb and hopeless. My outlook in life and hopes for my future is gone. I have no one to talk to because I was forced to cutoff contact with everyone- friends, family, coworkers. I lost vital documents and forms of contacts- I lost bank accounts, money, emails, pictures, phone numbers that my entire life was in. My laptop was broken in half, I went through three cell phones, I crashed one car into a brick wall, and had to give up the one that followed. I had to get rental cars after I crashed. I was living in motels, a new room every single day. I had to pay for everything- food, hotels, drugs.

He relied on me to provide everything in the height of a pandemic when I had no money. He manipulated me into buying him 2 phones and 3 laptops that were all broken or sold for half price to afford his drug habit. I was manipulated into buying a car under my name and credit just to return it for another vehicle because the first one wasn't nice enough. Just to return the second car for a newer vehicle. In order to make it happen, I had to trade in my car. I am now responsible for both our cars, all the debt that I incurred to survive, and all the bills. I went mentally crazy and had tried to commit suicide multiple times.

The mental games that I had to endure was unbearable. I ran back to him towards the end because of a thing called trauma bonding which is a very real and sad thing. He would physically, emotionally, and mentally hurt me, but he would make up for it by showing me the most extreme amount of love and affection. It's an addiction- fatal attraction.

And now I'm left hopeless in life with nothing but debt and mental and physical trauma and scars. And also an addiction. He introduced me to crack and crystal. I picked up a severe dope habit that made what I was going through bearable. I started with the syringe, then to snorting, then to smoking. I guess you could say it tapered down in severity, but my reliance and dependence on the drug became an addiction I didn't even know I had. I've always been a light recreational party drug user at the occasional social gathering but never had a problem because I knew my limits. I was thrown into an environment I didn't know anything about, manipulated, criticized, scrutinized, and belittled. The dope made everything bearable because I wouldn't have survived or stayed knowing that this is where I was at in life. It made facing the fact that this was my life acceptable. The dope played mental games in of itself with me. I was convinced that everything was okay and work out, that the person giving it to me genuinely loved me and that everything I endured was for a reason.

It is easy to say that COVID-19 has been difficult for everyone and has been detrimental to not only economic stability and growth, but to society's mental health and general well being. I share the hurt in my heart of those who have not only lost their jobs, but their families, friends, and homes.

Before COVID-19, I was a third year university student in the Bay Area working in retail to get by, studying early childhood development and behavioral sciences. I had plans to get my degree, start a career, and just go about adulthood.

But of course, it didn't go as I planned. And at the defining moment of trying to figure out who I am and what life has in store for me, I lost everything.

I share a very similar story with that of the average American during these times. I was devastated when I lost both jobs that I relied on to provide the most basic essentials for my survival. My classes at school had been suspended until further notice and my high hopes on life had started to fall short. I couldn't afford to pay rent. With no roof over my head and no one to call on, I got scared.

I jumped into a relationship during my darkest times and had to face the reality that it wasn't love, it was only making my situation worse.

Being in a new toxic environment with little hope for days ahead is difficult to leave but even harder to stay in.

I'm a 22 year old girl who was in college and ready to take on the world. I thought I had it all planned out. But like they always say, life doesn't go as planned. And just like that, I was homeless, no job or income, in a toxic relationship I relied on to provide any little happiness in life. Days where I had nowhere to sleep but my car. Feeling the embarrassment of getting caught by security because I tried to steal a bottle of water because I didn't have even enough coins to get water. And standing there hurt because not a single person offered to buy me one and feeling less than at their judgement. I felt completely alone and had multiple trips to the mental hospital because I couldn't stand the amount of things that life was throwing at me all at once.

But today, I have hope for the future and have started to take control of my life again. I look forward to starting classes again next semester. I appreciate the little stability I have in beginning a new job in the same general field. But I am still homeless and making nowhere near enough to support myself in any way.

I have also learned to set aside my pride and ask for help when I need it. At the end of the day, I would just like to have a home to go to at night, food for the day, and my bills on a realistic payment plan. Any assistance helps and any form or amount is enough because I know what it's like to have nothing.",1613048486

What a porn addiction has done to me,3,lh2v6r,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lh2v6r/what_a_porn_addiction_has_done_to_me/,2,"Hey guys I’m 20 years old I’m a dude and I just wanted to make this post to share my story and get some advice from anyone. 

I’m just coming to terms with this but I have been addicted to porn for the last 2-3 years at the least. It all started when I was in a relationship with my ex gf, porn caused me to crave new kinks and want other women. I began to neglect my gf and distance myself from her, I essentially showed her no love or affection and I was using her as a vessel to fulfill my kinks (looking back at this I’m horrified I want to cry) I was also chasing other women. Of course she broke up with me which destroyed me mentally. I tried everything in my power to change myself and become a better more self-aware person which has somewhat worked since I am here right now. What I failed to acknowledge was my porn use however, after the breakup my use went up and I’ve been addicted ever since. Looking back I think I can attribute my porn addiction to some of the problems I’ve been having. 

•Major Depression 

•Anxiety which I first noticed last year as my porn use peaked. Going up to a cashier gives me so much anxiety now, that was never a problem before I could even chat it up with them now I just go straight to self checkout from fear :(

• No type of self-worth I constantly tell myself I’m not good enough for certain things.  

• Lack of motivation to talk to women or start friendships as a matter of fact. I brushed it aside telling myself that I’m too young to even be wasting my time with women and that I should just be focused on myself and school but in reality that was just me being a coward. 

• Athletically I’m worse than I’ve ever been. I can’t run like I used to, I can’t move like I used to and I can’t enjoy gym time anymore I just dread it. I’m just so tired I can’t do these things. 

• Lack of concentration in school, I can’t read for shit I get so bored reading books and taking notes when that used to be so easy to me. I can’t pay attention to my zoom calls either. 

• Overall I just feel like I’m drifting through my life right now. I think if my teenager self were to meet me he’d be very ashamed. I used to have aspirations for life there was so much I wanted to do as a highschooler and I’ve accomplished nothing. I’m behind in college credits, I have very little money in my bank account. I live with my parents and have no plans to move out despite wanting to very badly. 

I don’t know if this is all due to my porn addiction but I firmly believe porn is responsible for my depression and anxiety which in turn has given me all these problems. I’m currently 2 days free of porn but man I’m desperate to change my life I’m desperate to have energy and get shit done I’m tired of being 20 and feeling like I’m 70. Any help is appreciated.",1613017395

I cannot go a day without smoking weed and I feel like I need it to get through my day.  I use so I can get some peace of mind, so the storm in my head stops and I can finaly let go of everything that doesn't matter. So I can have some rest in my body aswell. 

I started smoking around 15 years old (21 now almost 22). I was in a toxic relationship I won't go in to much detail about it, but after a year it finaly ended and I kept smoking because it helped me forget about him en relax. It wasn't daily in the beginning, but then I turned 18 and I could buy and consume weed legally. My friends smoke, so it became something we did together at this point it was already weekly. Then I made the mistake of moving out and not having my mom around (parents are divorced and my dad is also addicted to a lot of things, I don't even know it all) I had the freedom to smoke everyday. 

I never felt happier or more relaxed. I could handle my feelings, I wasn't as bad tempered  as I used to be and I became addicted. 

Just before my addiction I was diagnosed with depression and since I have also been diagnosed with a disorder that prevents me from having a normal controle over my emotions. I don't know the English name but litterally translated it would be Emotions Regulation Disorder and last month with ADHD. To add on that I also have a buch of trauma.  I know a great mix of shit and something that probably sounds familliar to a dagree. 

(But I never pittied myself and never wanted pitty, something I personly find import to add)

I want to start my ADHD medication, but my therapist won't allow me to start it before I get of my addiction. She and the head psychiatrist are afraid I will end up in a psychoses so the only option I have is to stop smoking. 

It upset me, it made me cry and I was extremely mad at myself. This was last Wednesday and since then I have made my peace, I'm not angry anymore, I really wanna do this and not just to start my medication, I want to do this for me

I want to stop and I will stop. I have already cut back a lot since last week. I smoked between 0,7 to 1,5 gram per day and now it's between 0,3 and 0,5 grams. I also didn't smoke after I got home from that appiontent, somthing I would have usualy done, I'm already proud of this change and I hope I can keep this up. 

My therapist and I are gonna look at rehab sessions that might help me and make a concrete plan.

Most has been once or twice a month, until the last couple years. I've gained over 120lbs in the last year and and half (350lbs now) and I've been consuming about 2 grm per week. I know it might not be a lot to some, and I feel I don't abuse the quantity compared to the frequency. However, I can't stop using for more than a few days. In the last year the most I've gone without using is two weeks. Normally I do it every day. Even if it's just a few lines. The problem also is I chain smoke about 2 packs when I'm in the ""zone"" and feeling the bliss. I also go over a bottle (sometimes 1.5) of alcohol as well. 

My routine consists of wearing comfortable clothes, mostly pjs, getting a tequila rose medium bottle and two packs of cigs. I do a line, take a sip of alcohol and then go smoke the cig in the patio while binge watching Netflix. As soon as I finish the cig I come inside, do another line, sip of alcohol and go outside again for another cig. Process takes until I ran out of cigs. Sometimes I go out and buy another pack or two. 

I do feel like shit. My house looks like I'm a hoarder, patio is overgrown with weeds and cig butts and I haven't washed my bed sheets in over two months. I know there's a lot to unpack here, and tons more going on. Just wanted to ""say it out loud"" to a stranger since I refuse to tell my family and friends.

Health care professional seeking advice. And/or constructive criticism.,4,lgv7im,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lgv7im/health_care_professional_seeking_advice_andor/,10,"Hello everyone!
I’m a paramedic in a city that has one of the highest overdose rates in the country. For HiPAA reasons I obviously won’t say where. The OD’s are endless, primarily heroin and fentanyl. Between that and all the other drug associated health problems, it’s a revolving door. I realize that they aren’t bad people. I don’t look down on them or think I’m any better than them. My heart goes out to them because I know they are broken people. There’s a million reasons why they could have ended up at that point. I do my best to show them kindness and treat them like a human being. Needless to say, it’s not always easy. 
   Here’s my question: those of you who have recovered, what did it take for you to finally recover? Is there anything I can say or do differently that may help them? I’m not nor have I ever been a drug addict so it’s hard for me to comprehend. I don’t get why someone would want to continue living the way they are for so long. Destroying their family, losing their kids, contracting diseases from needle sharing, endocarditis, it’s never ending. I hope that doesn’t come across judgemental because I’m truly not.

But just a soul crushing chain of events has put me back into this Nihilist state of mind, and I don't want to exist if I am not sober anymore. Everything hurts too much. I'm too pussy to kill myself, so self medication is a path I'm falling down again.

I wish I was ashamed, I wish I didn't want to do this  but if I'm being completely honest, I welcome this dark turn in my life with welcome arms.

I have a prescription for the Adderall for my ADHD, and I'm in my last semester of my undergraduate degree(s). I'm taking 21 credits, have a killer GPA, and start my first job on an archaeological dig site in a week. So I've been getting away with it (kinda), but I think it's almost time to pay the piper.

I've always known my relationship with alcohol has been unhealthy. I've said/done things I didn't mean, been in countless fights, and even crashed my cousin's truck into a mountain once. I've tried to quit/take a break dozens of times. Sometimes those ""breaks"" have even lasted a month, though it's been 3 years since the last time I made it into the double digits of sobriety. The past year with Covid has been especially tough because I got laid off, started online school, and gained like 20 lbs.

Here's the thing: for almost a year my stomach has been feeling pretty messed up, but the last month or so it's gotten BAD. ""Why don't you go to the doctor?"" one might ask. The truth is, I don't have health insurance and I haven't for years.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to read this book on pornography addiction for some time but I don’t know if I understand/agree with. It’s based on Allen Carr’s method of quitting smoking. I’m particularly stuck on this chapter, it’s linked above. It’s basically trying to prove that since all addicts are doing is relieving dopamine withdrawal pangs, there is no pleasure in porn. I’m not sure if I agree with that.

Would you guys mind reading it (it’s a very short chapter - should only take 5-10 mins) and telling me what you think?

I have never been a heavy user just because the way my body reacts just feel like I’m dying if I keep taking medications like I’m being poisoned highest dose I ever took of oxycodone was 30mg HCL for a couple months. The highest I ever took of a opioid was when they had OxyContin I was doing 60mg a day of that for a couple months.
I was taking 300mg gabapentin 3x daily during the time I was doing 30MG HCL oxycodone. Well I started having horrible stomach pains start shitting blood dark stools so I stopped the gabapentin and went through psychosis I was losing my mind for about a month..... anyway that stopped all my pains in my stomach and shitting blood.... I decided I was tired of looking like a ugly junky addict in the mirror even tho I get compliments on my devilish looks when I am on medications I feel like I am a ugly POS.... so I got myself down to 20MG Oxycodone then 10MG. During this whole time I am still addicted to marijuana co2 oil(legal state all tested)  And caffeine. So I have quit the marijuana oil and just started smoking marijuana to lower my tolerance. I only do caffeine under 100 MG. So as of right now 10MG oxycodone a day 15MG on a bad day, around half a 1/8 of marijuana a day, and caffeine sometimes and it’s always under 100MG. I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle the oxycodone doesn’t last long and I angry when it wears off I am also in pain from my lower back which gives me a excuse... why do I feel like my organs are shutting down but the doctors say nothing is wrong with me... oh yeah I thought I was gonna come off the oxy with the Xanax but I don’t know what the fuck happened I started taking them and the Xanax is almost gone 30 0.5 pills after only 4 days and They made me not care and I still popped the oxycodone ..... I don’t understand how people can keep upping the dosages don’t you feel like your insides are shutting down ? At this point I have like 300 10mg Oxycodones because I been tryna come off then over the months I don’t know what to do am I just that weak ?

I'm a highly functional two-faced person who only wants to do good for other people but despises myself,3,lgjr6d,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lgjr6d/im_a_highly_functional_twofaced_person_who_only/,5,"Hi!! It's my first time actually posting on reddit, and also on this sub (though I've been reading through so many posts).

I'm a 28 y/o male, living in an apartment with two of my best friends in a country in Europe. I studied civil engineering, I have an additional degree in Finance, I worked for a bank, an international dredging company, and now I'm studying Clinical Psychology (and a masters in Educational Sciences) as well as working full time as a mathematics teacher and volunteering in our (crumbling) mental health sector.

Unlike most people here, I don't have a simply confession to share. I do want to share a few things (I'll try to keep it short), mostly because I hope that one (or more) people out there can understand me and what I'm going through because up until this part none of my significant others (best friends, family, old girlfriends) ever 'really' did.

I've been a weird kid every since I went to school. I would do ANYTHING (literally anything) to make other people around me feel good. If that meant cussing to our teacher, stealing things, throwing things to someone, bullying someone, ... I did it all as long as it made me feel other people would stay around me and I could be friends with them. Up until now, at my 28th year, that never changed.

I was also always highly intelligent, my teachers and school director have never tried giving up trying to kick me out of school because of my behavioral problems, but my grades were too good and I was one of the more fortunate kids. I went to a very rich white school, but I think I was always the poorest (my parents never finished high school, my dad worked in a mine and my mother was a secretary).

The first time I went into coma from drinking was when I was 16. I was so hyped, on our way to a party that I spiked a bottle of pure vodka to impress my mates (again, I never once thought what could be the repercussions for me). Safe to say, I'm glad I made it out alive. My parents were furious.

Fast forward and we're 22 years later. I've been binging on coke for the last few weeks, and drinking myself absolutely stupid. I got caught with a DUI a few month ago, I was also on coke and the police didn't test me for it (even though I admitted it, I really dodged a bullet). But aside from that, I'm still highly functional. I'm hardly ever late for work, I try to do anything to help my students feel good about themselves and make them achieve what they want to, and I'll never stop believing in other people. My shrink tells me that's one of my major issues; the fact that I don't have many reasons to quit.

My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me last December. She told me it felt so unnatural for her, because I focused so much on her and tried to love her so much (and literally do anything for her) that she saw me completely disappearing from myself. I told her I didn't know what she meant, it's hard to realize you're not 'close to yourself' if you've never really met yourself or spent time with yourself. I'm so frightened of being alone.

My mother was very abusive since I was young, a token narcissist. She would lie to me almost every day, hide the house keys and blame me for losing them (so I wasn't allowed to eat for 2 days or leave my room), tell me I'm the most useless kid on the planet, and almost bully my father to death. I still see her, she's very old but she's never admitted anything.

I feel like I'm slipping away, I've been drinking and doing a multitude of drugs ever since I got away from home (18), and it's difficult to stop. It's not exactly like I can't control myself, because I think I can. But my whole life consists of other people and how they view me, the people I care about. If I could be an organ donor, I'd sign myself up for two hearts and two livers and two brains; even though we only carry one of each.

I'm not a lonely person, but I feel so distant from myself because I never got to know what I actually liked. I always turned to other people and tried what they did; and if it was cool and it worked, I thought: fuck it! I LOVE IT.

\- I told my ex I was a professional skateboarder even though I've never done an ollie before;

\- I tell people I'm rich even though I'm absolutely not;

\- I exaggerate almost everything, and I hardly ever tell the truth.

Does anyone here recognize some of these things? I feel like I'm becoming an empathic version of the sociopath my mother was, and that scares me. Even my best friends, I manipulate them on a daily basis and lie to them just to keep my image high that nothing is wrong. I've been going to psychiatrists (who gave me meds I was and maybe still am completely addicted to) and different therapists, but they usually tell me because they don't really understand me.

At day 28 I made another decision to stop what I was doing and do the right thing. I was in the process of relapse I was mentally relapsed already and moving on to physically relapse. At this point, I made myself accountable. I gave all my shit I was going to sell to my Mom and told her under NO circumstance to let me leave the house. This was when I feel like the obsession was really lifted. The next day the obsession was more or less gone. This was because I had put myself in a position where I cannot relapse. If you can make yourself **accountable.** Give cash to a trusted individual. Don't put yourself in those situations in early recovery.

Another way I have been taking action is by working the steps. I have been working daily to grind out these steps. Doing the work makes living soberly tolerable.

BF agreed to treatment; hasn't been taking his Naltrexone,2,lge2k7,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lge2k7/bf_agreed_to_treatment_hasnt_been_taking_his/,8,"The first week of January I found out my boyfriend is addicted to pain killers. I've known that he had a drinking problem. He had, at least in front of me, cut down. But I busted him hiding vodka and a search of his car yielded a number of cash withdrawal slips totaling over $1700 over 6 weeks. He admitted he has been snorting pain killers for more than 5 years. He claims it is only every few weeks and that he splits it with a friend. He says he maybe spends $400 a month. This doesn't add up to me. It was a scary confrontation. He was hysterical and talking to himself about suicide. I agreed to stay together if he committed to treatment. I know he has been to appointments. I saw the intake folder and he has a bottle of Naltrexone. But he has expressed concerns about money. And it made me suspicious. He is working and has few expenses. We live together and I checked his bottle of Naltrexone. He should've been taking it for 2 weeks by now. There are 30 out of 30 pills in the bottle. 

Is he most likely lying about historically taking drugs a fews time a month? Is he most likely lying about how much he was spending? Is there any reason (other than still using) that he wouldn't be taking Naltrexone? He gets up twice a week and at least says he goes to outpatient appointments. I just can't make sense of anything.

One week until rehab (GHB),10,lfs1qb,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lfs1qb/one_week_until_rehab_ghb/,2,"Hi everyone,

I've never felt so divided on something in my life. I live in the Netherlands so I am in no place to complain about drug policy and healthcare here. Im 28 years old and have been using xtc, speed, weed, ketamine, 2CB, LSD and GHB recreationally for about 10 years on festivals and afterparties. I never had any problems with addiction, im the only one in my group of friends that doesn't even smoke. I've always concidered myself someone who is extremely lucky (I have the best friends, a loving family and I would be the one who would find 50 euro's on a nights out etc).

Untill two years ago when my eight year relationship ended out of nowhere, I lost 3 young patients at work (19, 4 and 4) after horrific long resucitation and having to inform their parents , I had to move back in with my parents and my cat died (that last one may seem rediculous to mention to some but I loved that furry satan so much). 

I noticed that especially GHB and speed helped me suppress the worst feelings that I had. The GHB kept me in a dream like state where all my problems seemed way less worse and the speed kept me awake so I wouldn't have to lie in bed and have all my depressing thoughts rush through my head. I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD (the PTSD symptoms manifested in the sudden feeling of warm blood on my hands like with my patients, the smell of the hospital room or beeping sounds like the monitors or ECG machine). After almost a year of living with my parents the situation became so bad that my parents (that love me a lot a I love them) told me to seek help or they would kick me out on the street). I had been using GHB and speed non stop since I lived there and they found me KO twice, which must have been horrible as parents to see your son like that...

I got help from my GP and managed to get sober at home with diazepam and got myself a house. I got sober for 7 months, but after 1 month the pandemic started and I felt an obligation to start helping. I got a job as an intensive care nurse at the local hospital during the first wave where I lost patients daily. This in combination with the untreated depression, PTSD and self-quarantining meaning I didn't see any of my friends and family for months resulted in my house becoming a disgusting mess and me quitting my job once I noticed I couldn't handle daily life without drugs. I quit before I started using again because the last thing I would want is me endangering my patients because of me not being sober.

At the start of this year my house was filled with garbage, including pissbottles and thrash up to the knees....My neighbours started hearing weird sounds coming from my house and were worried something was wrong and rang the bell a few times but no one opened the door. They called the police and by the time they arrived I was ""sober"" enough to hear the doorbell, so I opened the door. They told me they could clearly see that I was under the influence of something and that they were worried about my safety. When they stepped inside and asked me why I was living like this and what the white powder and the glass of GHB was I broke down. They immediatly called the psych crisis line and got me a meeting with a psychiatrist and refused to leave my house untill I got a good friend or family member to come over. I called my sister and my best friend and since they know I slowly started telling the rest of my friends and family. All of them reacted in the best way possible and support me in the times to come.

I've been waiting until the 15th of feb, this is my admission date in a clinic. I'm scared for what is to come and I feel so guilty. Guilty over making my loved ones worry about me, about having to seek medical attention during a time that the healthcare system is already under an enormous amount of stress and about fucking up my health and future. I love taking care of friends and patients and have not really been able to for the last 2 years. And I hate having to be looked after. The thing that also haunts me is that for the last month the psych and my GP told me to continue to use GHB because of the dangers of stopping without medical attention. This is resulting in me using non stop longer then I have ever used before. I feel like this is making the process of quitting harder then it is going to be...I have to stop writing now because this post is becoming way longer then I intended to be, even though I already left a lot out that I wanted to tell...If you have made it all the way to the end, thanks for reading.

Alcoholic seizures,5,lfwn03,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lfwn03/alcoholic_seizures/,4,What percentage of people actually experience alcohol withdrawal seizures? I’m a 22 year old female have been drinking heavily for almost a year and just found out about it and the thought of having a seizure gives me a horrible panic attack since I don’t think I ever experienced seizure and I live by myself and scared of actually dying after having one. I sometimes fall asleep and suddenly wake up shaking as if someone tapped on my shoulder or scared me and it lasts for a second I don’t know if that’s a seizure or just falling asleep while cold but it’s scary. Has anyone actually experienced alcohol seizures?,1612881723

Addiction is so fucking weird. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever feel genuine immense happiness towards anything other than heroin again. I am happy for the most part... it’s just moments like this that make me realize that I don’t ever feel as happy as I did when I was was getting my stuff. Does anyone else ever feel this way?

First time in this subreddit. My ex-gf (we're still in touch) has a substance abuse history, and recently she had an episode with Ambien where she lost her dog (thankfully it found its way home). She gave her parents part of her stash of Ambien, and said she couldn't bear to part with all of it. I convinced her to give me the rest.

My question now is, what do I do with it? Do I throw it away? Do I offer to supervise her next time she absolutely needs it?

And do I take a firm stance with her or an empathetic approach?

I want to help her but am not sure how to navigate this kind of situation effectively.",1612868682

I’ve tried the nightly inventory and praying when fear or resentment pops up but it always pops up. I feel like doing the work has made me feel worse and I can’t go back to the way that I used to love but I still feel terrible.

I’ve tried messing with my sleep to make sure I’m well rested, exercising, giving myself more me time, calling people. I feel like I’ve exhausted every possible resource to try to be okay.

And as a result of this I questioned prayer and I see god in the actions of doing the right thing but I don’t feel like prayer works for me! I still feel like ass! 

I’m a sponsor and try to go out of my way to help people. I know the jig book in and out. I just feel hopeless. My mind attacks me. Pray, don’t pray, get a lot of sleep, don’t sleep at all.

I'm addicted to winning,0,lftgtn,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lftgtn/im_addicted_to_winning/,14,"I'm at a point in my life where I've basically finished the race and I can't stop, I'm too good to stop.
So basically I invent new challenges to conquer.
Like my literally I think from the age of 7 I've been just plowing forward no fucks given.

The plus side is = there's nothing like winning.

The minus side is = idgaf about anything else.

If something is easy = I won't even look at it.
But tell me something can't be done and I'll prove you wrong, regardless if it takes me years to achieve = I will prove you wrong.
Any challenge is personal and I will win.

So you see, as I only have my eyes on the future and the outcome = I ignore almost 100% of what is here.
Even the good things that would help me, like getting a girlfriend, relaxing, living stress free or something along those lines.

Not to mention I don't fit in anywhere except (maybe prison 50-50 or with criminals but even then it's a group thing and if we go at something we must all be on the same level to accomplish greatness) because normal people don't seem to be hyper-competitive.

I don't use drugs, altho I like acid and Rc's.
Cocaine turns me into a monster so I don't use it.
Basically I don't use drugs because stimulants = I don't need.
And downers = slow me down and I'm uncomfortable slowing down.

What I'm saying is: I've won in life, there are no more interesting challenges because I'm used to quick reaction to unexpected situations where you either think fast or you're fucked.

So right now I don't know what to say but I think I'd like to slow down but how.

Like imagine every good thing is waiting for you on the other side - just stop surviving and thriving.

It's come to a point where I view anything what people find normal as an unnecessary luxury i.e. "" I can manage without it"", things like money and stuff.
Basically very stubborn and aggressive towards anything.",1612869950

Being content with current situation,2,lfhk3m,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lfhk3m/being_content_with_current_situation/,1,"It's been a month since I drank, it was definitely testing my self control when I was offered drinks by friends this past weekend. My motivation for staying clean has been to be a better husband number 1 as well as hitting some financial/ career goals. 

It is tough sometimes trying to explain to others why I'm not drinking. My wife took a month break with me but now is casually drinking on the weekends which doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I think the reason being is that I am determined to hit my goals paying off debt and getting a better job. Even though this is delayed gratification I am trying to stay focused on the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Even though I love beer, I'm contemplating if i'm better off not drinking again even after hitting my goals because I had gotten to the point of not being able to stop after just 1 or 2 drinks. 

To anyone who is having a tough time, YOU GOT THIS! Set some clear goals and try to stay active and refocus on better things. I have been slowly trying to get healthier and i'm pretty proud of where I am but know that there's a long road ahead.

Yesterday i was with my SO and we went to the house of one of her friends. Until something like 8PM it was kinda normal,we just were hanging out and drinking soda. Then friends of her friend arrived with weed and whiskey.  


They were smoking and drinking and i was like ""shit,i love whiskey but i can't drink,what should i do?"". But then i remembered something i learned at the meetings. Avoiding.   


I went to the master bedroom and just stayed there,thinking of other things. Thinking of my SO who didn't use nothing because she knows what i've been through,of my friends at N.A,Battlefield 1... In the end i slept.  


It was a REALLY dangerous situation. I didn't knew there would be weed and drink,that's why i accepted to go. My SO didn't knew too.

I've been using meth most days for the last three weeks. I was 4 years clean before this. My brother came back from rehab with a habit, and he offered me a deal. Every day I have off I just sleep and hate myself. I've blown off work a fair amount, stopped college before I even restarted. And am broke 90percent of the time and recently got a stupid quick cash loan too get more. It's put me in debt  I feel the dopamine damage and loath having to go through withdrawal and recovery. It took me over a year to recover in the past. And 5 months of that was in long term rehab. I can't tell my family as I fear being booted out of the house. They are supportive. They've just recently dealt with a string of chronic weed relapses by me resulting in detox, some of that was also benzo withdrawal. I can honestly get suicidal when I think of what I've screwed up. I need a purpose and a way out. Im only 23 but I feel trapped in the drug lifestyle and can't continue on like this for much longer. I just wanna backtrack to three too four weeks ago where I was a month clean off of everything. Motivated and loving my life and family. I'm in extreme guilt now, I have a strong relationship with my little brother but can't hang out with him over the guilt of constantly letting him down. This sounds depressing but I needed somewhere to say this. I have hope for myself. I just need too go to meetings again and start doing stuff that's healthy. It's just so hard. I feel like I'm in a hole and the only way out is too keep using but that only brings me back further down in my comedowns. I wanna enjoy playing video games like I absolutely loved without this god aweful substance in my body. I wanna be able too talk to my little brother guilt free.

Are we prioritizing Harm Reduction over Treatment?,5,leupte,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/leupte/are_we_prioritizing_harm_reduction_over_treatment/,18,"I interviewed a lady on the YouTube series; Koffee With Kuda. She said, she feels that harm reduction “cuddles” people in addiction. She wasn’t 100% against harm reduction, but her point was ‘we prioritize this so much that we lose focus on helping an addict to get treatment/ recovery. “Harm reduction almost emphasizes this method first before offering recovery and treatment”, said another person. 

I would like to hear from former opiates addicts, as well as front line workers and professionals who work in addiction. Does Harm Reduction cuddle addicts? Or is it mandatory to wellness?

Thank you for input. Your comments will be referred to on our Instagram live, as well on future YouTube content.

"I’m having my little brother committed. Depression, coke/kat/ket addiction + involuntary hospitalisation and rehab. I feel sick",6,leqs6j,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/leqs6j/im_having_my_little_brother_committed_depression/,11,"I’m having my little brother committed, and I hate myself for having to do this. Any advice, support for family members of involuntary treatment?

My (37f) younger brother (36m) has had an incredibly tough year. 

He lost his job (and his savings) due to massive fraud going on at the company which he was totally unaware of. 

He is in the middle of an ugly custody fight with his (frankly, awful) ex over their 18month child which has landed him in loads of debt and heartache over missing his child. 

He also has developed a nasty drug habit as a result (cocaine / kat / ket) ... all of which has transformed him as a person from the amazingly thoughtful, caring little brother I loved, to a bitter angry and depressed human. 

It’s come to the point where he’s threatening suicide and downing sleeping pills in a  dangerous way. He’s refused to go to any sort of rehab but said he might be willing to see a professional. 

To give some context, my father committed suicide when we were in our teens.. apparently this makes his risk of suicide substantially higher than average. 

My family has taken the decision to get him help - hopefully voluntarily, but forcibly if he doesn’t cooperate. It’s genuinely our last resort and we would not be doing this if we thought we could help him in any other way. 

Once he is taken away (ugh) he will be hospitalised for 72 hours for initial assessment and stabilising. From there he will be taken to an excellent psychiatric and addiction recovery centre for around 3 months. 

I’m really struggling with this decision. Even though I know it’s best for him, I’m terrified at his reaction and heartbroken at the idea of what lies ahead for him. Even though I’m doing this because I love him and want to help, I know he is going to feel betrayed.

Has anyone been through a similar situation where a family member or friend has been sectioned for rehab, particularly against their will? 

I’d appreciate any advice on how to support him and myself through this. Thanks for reading.",1612747262

I hope you’re all doing great. 

My name is Zachary Scoular. I’m a Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps and an Ultra-Marathon runner. 

I am trying to help those who suffer/have suffered from addiction through sports. 

On March 5-7th, I will be doing the David Goggins 4 miles, every 4 hours, for 48 hours challenge to pay tribute and bring attention to the opioid epidemic + the fundraiser I have started.  

As many of you know, the vast drug problem we face worldwide is getting worse every year. 

To combat this, I am hosting a 5K Awareness Run and Recovery Festival on August 29th, 2021 (national overdose awareness day). In my hometown New Milford, Connecticut, USA, all with the help from #BrianCodysLaw foundation - a group dedicated to fighting addiction. 

While I am ecstatic about this, there is still much work to do! We need to raise funds in order to cover application fees, supplies, and more so we can keep the event free of charge for those who attend. Here is a link to the fundraiser I started. 

It would be fantastic if you all could help me spread the word. Thank you 🙏🏻

Can I just start treatment at separate facilities and not mention the other parts I need help with.

Every few weeks it seems my boss hires a whole new crew. Well last week he hired a new cook. Her first day she broke down, and started crying because a regular customer pushed the start button to brew a new pot of coffee. She didn't like the way he said not to worry about it. She went from a 10 in being mad, to a 10 in crying. I had to let her use my weed vape in order for her to calm down. I knew right then she was drunk. I confirmed my suspensions when the next day she drove me to pick up weed at her hook up. She told me that her water bottle was filled with ""mama juice"" and I was the only one that knew. We stopped at her house before going to get the weed, because she had to take a shot. She asked if I wanted to come in for a shot. I said no since I don't drink.

My boss also hired a guy who lives in my building. I really don't know him that well, except that he doesn't smoke weed. The first week working with him went well. I had no suspensions at all, but the start of the second week I knew. Last Monday he came in smelling of alcohol. Very friendly with everyone, especially the new cook who was also drinking. As soon as he walked up to the door, he said he could make the new girl cum in one second. With that he put his pointer finger in the air, and twilled it around. I said have at it.

Mmmm.

This is, somewhat ironically I guess, not a post about how meth ruined my friendship. I've fucked up a respectable chunk of my own life and relationships with/over drugs, sure - but that's not how it went down this time. If meth has been my long-standing no-strings casual lil fun buddy, heroin is my (now estranged) codependent abusive lunatic of an ex spouse. I mean: meth use for me is and has been something of a highly-functional crutch for me, sure - but I ain't no stranger to the gutter. Been there before and barely made it out myself. Fucked up, sabotaged and avoided plenty of shit I shouldn't have in the past.

But that ain't how it went down this time.

This time I've been keeping both feet pretty damn safely on the sidewalk. No slipping into the ditch this time for me. Not for a pretty long while. This time was something different; this was a new one for me. Well, I say ""new""; to be fair, the only new thing about it is the fact that, this time, I didn't see it coming. This time it was someone i actually gave a shit about. This time it happened after I'd gotten comfy and complacent in a little nest I'd built up after years of halfway almost kinda sorta not-really assimilating myself into ""normal"" society. Not-really - but enough to make me forget that most super friendly awesome nice people I come into contact with are the same people who'd have an altogether different attitude towards me a few years ago - when anyone could spot mud from the gutters all over me from a mild away.

This time I didn't do shit wrong. This time I'd been going to work and paying my bills and mowing my lawn and helping my neighbors and being there for my friends and respecting my elders and all that ethical nice guy shit I had to fight to learn from scratch. Did a damn fine job of it imo.

And then shit happens like this that makes me wonder why tf I ever wanted to be who and where I am now, makes me legitimately miss the gutter at my core and feel as though the gutter is undoubtedly where I belong. I feel homesick.

My best friend, of several years now, is an alcoholic. It was a budding development when we met. Hes a few years younger than me and bloomed a bit later in the season. It's pretty new for him. He's not been around the whole block even once yet. He knew who I'd been, who I am, what I'd done and what I do early on. I was upfront about it with him as acquaintances - used my own experiences to let him know he wasn't alone. I understood what was happening to him and I'd be there for him whenever he needed an empathetic ear.

Several years later I see the same mud on his shoes that I'd been engulfed in before, creeping up his ankles a little at a time. I still know what's happening. I still understand.

I understand the feeling of looking at your jeans in horror not knowing how tf to stop it from creeping past your ankles to your knees to your chest to your damn eyeballs. I know how it feels to have no other accessible option at hand but to keep your head at an up tilt and swear to God your ankles are as clean as your first communion and that everyone else is delusional when they notice the growing filth.

I get it, I do. But what happened this time still fucking stings.

He'd had an epiphany of his own. Mid-conversation, in fact. In the middle of an unrelated, standard conversation via text between best friends. Between friends that had called one another family. 

He'd suddenly realized that I was a piece of shit.

I joked. My replies to this outpouring of insults were jokes. I didn't see the seriousness. I couldn't imagine. It hit me, I thought, and I turned to compassion - ""he's really, *really* drunk - losing his shit a little for a minute, here"". I texted back that I loved him, that I thought he needed some food and some sleep. Hoped he felt better soon. Still hadn't quite figured out what this was.

A solid 20 mins were spent pretty effectively ripping me apart. told me that  my life was shit, I was doing shittily in life, that id deluded myself into thinking I was halfway intelligent and halfway human. In reality my brain was a rotten pile of shit and I was still and will always be a stupid sketchy lying stealing soulless junkie piece of shit. He was far too much better than such a worthless turd as myself to associate with my kind a moment longer. Sure, he drank - but I used to do  *heroin*.  I currently used *meth*. Ugh. Toss me in the dumpster before the rot spreads to you nice, respectable, simple drinkin' folk - hurry.

A couple weeks went by, having been blocked and deleted on all social media platforms and on the phone. I still thought he'd have come around by now, surely, its just awkward to try to reestablish contact after something like that. Thought I'd be playful, maybe cheer him up, create a throwaway snapchat account - username and display name references to inside jokes of ours.

I added him, just to tell him that we were still cool as far as I was concerned and that I love him. Meant to quickly disappear after a short, friendly little message. He should know that I haven't been holding a grudge, but I should let him come around on his own time. Just a short friendly little nudge.

With that, today, I'd discovered I'd had it all wrong. Another lengthy, hostile character assassination for me. Weeks later. He'd actually meant it. He was sticking by this decision. This was real.

This time I was on the other end of another addict's self-destruct mission. This time I didn't do shit wrong.

I didn't do shit wrong this time and I was still taking familiar punishment as if I had. This time the punishment didn't just come in the form of insults - but also in the form of having to know that my best friend just decidedly pushed away the only person he currently knows who doesn't judge him for his muddy ankles just as harshly as he'd just judged me for mine.

In being made to feel like a piece of shit, in subsequently trying to assimilate and appease judgemental, unempathetic peers: my best friend had pushed away the only friend he had that that didn't see him as a piece of shit - by seeing that friend as a piece of shit. Like a fucking labyrinth. Like a God damn ouroboros.

This shit fucking stings.

I can't help feeling homesick. I feel out of place. Like I know too much truth to fit in here. Like I don't know enough about lies to fit in here. Like I'm too fuckin tired to tolerate anything but the brutal honesty of the gutter anymore. At least there's no fucking pageantry or posturing there. Everyone's covered in mud. You know it, I know it, our comrades know it and our critics know it - and there's no denying it and no shame. I never thought I'd genuinely miss ""rock bottom"" like a favorite childhood stuffed animal. I never thought trying to do the ""right things"" for myself would feel like such a farce and such a betrayal of my nature.

I wanna go home.",1612618009

Well, I find myself fighting against the doctor’s recommendation of decreasing the frequency.

My cocaine addiction over the last 2-3 years has delayed my future goals and what I want out of life,8,ld4t1i,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ld4t1i/my_cocaine_addiction_over_the_last_23_years_has/,5,"Hi all,

To start, I work 3 jobs, 1 full time and 2 casual, I'm 24 and still live at home. Tallying roughly 50-60 hours per week. My problem isn't that I'm financially stable with the amount of income I am earning. But I've have been doing coke for 2-3 years ever since I got involved with drugs. It became really bad around the end of 2019 where I couldn't go a few days without it. Fast forward to today and I still find myself thinking about it often enough to want to change the habit of doing it. When I say every now and then its once a week... Ill go on 4-7 day streaks without thinking about it but on the days I do think about it I can't go back. Once the idea of getting some is in my head its full steam ahead and I end up getting coke and feeling bad the next day because I know it's the wrong decision. 

To provide context, I use snapchat to contact my dealer(s) and one of those is a close friend. Not sure if I should just delete snapchat and just not contact the two people I source from again.

This hasn't caused any financial hardship or strain on any relationships but it does set me back from personal goals (move out, buy a house etc) and the things I want to achieve in life. I'm in a good position at work (entry level IT job) and I just want to get out of this negative headspace. 

I guess I'm curious to know what mechanisms should I implement to stop this. Is it all in my head? Do I need to find a replacement for it? I don't have many hobbies per say and I don't have anything I'm passionate about and spend time doing. Should I find a hobby? I've thought of seeing a counsellor?

Any advice or responses would be appreciated because I honestly don't know what to do next and I don't want to ruin my future and want to know the best possible way to get rid of this.. If you are curious as to anything please comment and I will answer, I'm fairly active on Reddit... Thanks all.",1612551392

Things aren’t great, as I just found out my best friend has lung cancer and I already lost my other friend exactly a year ago to brain cancer. But the important thing is that I’m sober. Again lol. 

I tapered slowly and used my need to save up for a new truck as motivation. I’ve only had 2 small relapses (one bump each) since, and have tossed the rest of my drugs. I am scared shitless that another bout of depression will make my urge to use too strong but I am hopeful. I have dumped my rebound gf that was also a opioid user and would at times, encourage me to keep using. I was just using her to fill the void my ex left anyway when I think about it. 

The final straw was when my latest ex told me I stopped breathing while I slept and shook me awake. I don’t know if I believe this, as she is a bit of a pathological liar, and i don’t think you can make someone start breathing again by shaking them 🙄. But regardless, it kind of woke me up, and made me not want to die in a bed with someone that I wasn’t really in love with and from an addiction that made me into a zombie almost 24/7.

I’m a 15 year old male and I have been using since age 14 I was prescribed about 5 months ago 20mg Ritalin LA and I quickly became addicted without even realising I had a problem until it was too late....

When I first took it I had one of the best 8 hours I ever had because I hadn’t had any previous drug experience before it besides a bit of weed.

After about 3 weeks of 20mgLA I started skipping days and i would take 2 the next day, it was the best feeling ever because I thought I had my life back on track but I was so wrong, anyways so I got my dose upped to 30mg after 2 months so at that point I could miss a few days and take 90 sometimes 120mg of Ritalin. Then I began snorting it and at that point I had built up a massive tolerance and It stopped feeling good, instead it made me feel anxious, tired and depressed and on edge constantly. And I started to drink and I would occasionally take opioids to make me feel like myself again.

Recently it was upped to 36mg concerta and I feel even worse on it but I can’t seem to quit for more that a few days without going back to it, I feel trapped because it makes me feel like shit but I feel like I can’t stop because I go into withdrawals and feel worse.

First 2 months were like a dream but they quickly turned into a nightmare, I had no idea how addictive it was until recently and i feel like I’ve lost my personality and friends.

I went to rehab a year ago (for alcohol, amphetamines, weed, benzos and kratom) and got a few months of sobriety under my belt. Things were going well. My marriage strengthened. Started new meds but I ended up relapsing on tianeptine and have been using it for months but im trying to quit. I think ill be able to do it. I'm incredibly frustrated with myself. 

The problem is that I don't want to tell my wife. If she knew she would most likely leave me and the thought of that is horrible. I dont know what I'd do without her. 

I'm hesitant to call my sponsor bc I assume he'll tell me that I have to tell my wife. 

Have any of you been in this situation? How did you handle it? I really don't want to tell her and am thinking I could just go to meetings on my own and get through this without tearing my life apart. I know it's horrible. What do I do? Is it okay to find help without her having to know? Thanks for your input and for reading this. I appreciate it",1612517682

And do women blame their boyfriends a lot for this? Additional question: have you ever heard of someone hiding their drug habit when they meet a new partner only to find out that their partner also has a drug habit so they start doing drugs with that partner and claimed their partner was the one to introduce them to drugs?

I am a poly addict to the core. I latch on to anything that alters or numbs my reality like my life depends on it and when I have destroyed my life/am miserable “enough” to finally get off the substance, two more take its place. I have been to multiple rehabs, detoxes, a psych ward, others, and recently joined an(other) IOP. I joined on my own terms; no one suggested I should nor was I legally obligated. I just knew something had to be done.

I started the program a couple weeks ago to get off a particularly awful substance but am still hiding a couple others. Why!?
I am paying a lot of $ to hide and not work on myself/real problem. Why!?

I am disgusted with who I am today; who I always have been? Was I born lying? 

Addiction is a hell of a disease.

Thanks for reading. Hopefully writing this will be helpful for me to bridge the gap. All I am doing is lying to and hiding from myself. I want help, this could be the last chance I have.",1612536833

I feel like I’m in this deep hole I have been digging  the past 7 years. Everyday this beautiful version of myself(the one that was me before I smoked) comes to my hole with shovel. He puts a couple scoops of dirt in every day. It falls on my face, it gets in my eyes and stings, and it ends up getting in every place I wouldn’t want it to. However this hole is slowly being filled, and with every shovel of dirt I get inches closer to the surface of my new self. I used to not even be able to make out the sunlight because I was so far gone in this hole, darkness crept into almost every crevice, but I see sunlight now and every day it’s brighter. Every day more hopeful then before, stronger. My old self might have to get some blisters, because there is still a lot of dirt that needs to fall on my head to get me out of this dark place. But I know once I crawl out of that hole I’ll be stronger, an even better version of myself before smoking. We will get threw today, and tomorrow even the next. I’m crying right now writing this.

I’ve been addicted to porn since I was 9, now I’m 23. It started through a friend I honestly wish I never had. Ever since then my addiction has been like roller coaster, I’ve had few good years when I haven’t even given thought to porn and then times when half of my holiday has gone by and I haven’t eaten anything, gone to shower or left my home and don’t have food. 

Worst of this all is that I’m engaged, and he doesn’t know. I’m really good at hiding this, like probably all of us addicts are. And I feel like I’m cheating on him, even though we’ve talked about porn and how it’s totally okay.

However I do think this impacts a lot of people and does massively hurt productivity.

My addiction is media. Youtube, Netflix, TV or podcasts. I cant complete any task without consuming some kind of media. Tidying my room, doing a uni assignment, cooking dinner or brushing my teeth. I don't think this is healthy as I can no longer just be alone with my own thoughts. I take twice as long to do a uni assignment and the product I end up with is twice a bad/shoddy because I don't have full concentration. Whenever I do something it has to be there and it wears down on me, make's me s frustrated with myself that I can be so easily distracted and don't have the will power to do tasks that takes minutes without having some random youtube video on to entertain me. At a low point mental health wise and I know being productive massively helps my mental well being and I see getting rid of this media consumption as a way to bring my productivity up and therefore my mental health.

Why I've done drugs for 25 years...,28,lc8o2i,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lc8o2i/why_ive_done_drugs_for_25_years/,20,"I have been using drugs since I was 18 years old.  I'm 45 now and don't think I was ever sober except for two days in my 20's.  I started with ecstasy, weed, and my favorite GHB.  I would occasionally do coke and meth, tried LSD and Shrooms, but hated psychedelics.  

I was addicted to GHB for 6 years everyday.  Than the US had to ban some chemicals for GHB so I became an alcoholic for two years than stopped bc I started playing poker and played better when sober.  

Than I had surgery on my elbow and started taking pain medication.  It started with the blue Vicodin's (don't remember the name) than found a shady Dr who prescribed me Norcos.  I was addicted to Norco's for 3 years.  I've had the most success in life using Norco's and adderalls.  This was the start of my part time professional poker career (I had a good computer gig FT).  I took adderalls and Norcos and made over $900k in online poker in 5-6 years and my biggest win was a $140k in one poker tournament.  I got to play at the WSOP with all expenses paid and a suite for 1 week, play in the main event at the WPT, go to the Bahamas and Florianopolis, Brazil and other places to play poker.  Than George fucking Bush banned online poker in the U.S.  To this day it was called Black Friday.  

Afterwards my life started going downhill.  I had problems looking for a job, but got lucky finding one.  When everything went to shits was when I started shooting Heroin and smoking meth everyday with my ex GF.  I got arrested for the first time at 40, did county time, got released on a suspended sentence, kept getting caught with dirty UA's and went to prison and sentenced to 8 years for conspiracy.  Got released early after doing a year and a half and now I'm on ab109 and I don't know how long probation will be.  I found a job sober for the first time in my life and it's one of the worst paying jobs I've ever had.  At least I get tips and with a felony record I'm blessed I have a job.  

Doing drugs for 25 years straight has made me a different, but a better person in a way.  I would never have won all that money, never would have gone through all these life experiences, and never would have met the people I've met throughout my life.  At 18 I raved for 12 years going one-three times monthly and having the time of my life.  I've been with the most beautiful women in the world, models, pornstars, and drop dead gorgeous women.  The one regret I have is the girl that snitched on me and started my downfall.  I lost my career, got a felony record, lost my place, lost my investments, savings, and a big part of me.  I can't do drugs or I'll go back to jail.  I find this ridiculous bc I perform well high.  Drugs have given me confidence, help me learn and work hard and this has all been taken away.  Not every person is the same.  Some people can't handle drugs and some like myself perform at the highest level.  Are better people and stay out of trouble high.  

When I got out of jail and even now with a job, being sober is boring.  Boredom leads to loneliness, and loneliness leads to depression and depression can lead to suicide.  When I've been high, I've always been content.  Never bored or felt lonely and always content.  Probation is a joke. I did my time, I want to be free again and live.  I do not need someone watching over me and making sure I don't fuck up.  I'll fuck up bc of the pressure they put on me. Not everyone is the same.  They don't understand this.",1612445719

My friend group and I always recreationally used drugs but I initially became reliant on benzos to curb my anxiety -- I have suffered with mental health issues like anxiety, depression and OCD - all diagnosed but I feel it is likely I also have PTSD - (I am on Prozac) since I was a preteen, age 11-12, due to my father being an alcoholic in my early life and then absent (he is now clean and in my life) and being molested when I was 12. 

Due to the benzos I was able to attend the top school I'd got into (Ivy) and maintain a life for myself, and then I was even able to confront the problem and attend outpatient treatment whilst hours away from my family and I am clean from benzos. However I begun to notice severe mood swings as Christmas drew nearer and when I went home to my family, what was meant to be a two week stay has turned into two months. I am bed ridden and my mood swings are uncontrollable and almost psychotic. I turned to cocaine and I am using daily in my bed alone. My parents are aware and do what they can to confiscate my drugs but they can't do it completely successfully. To add to the trauma I suffered a shock miscarriage - I was on birth control and took it perfectly as with my mental health history I am well versed in taking pills on schedule. I have since stopped taking it.

I cannot afford rehab, am terrified of losing the structure of school, and finally I am feeling guilt arise over my best friend's suicide. I feel like I am out of control of my coke use and I don't know if I'll make it to my psychiatric appointment I have booked later this month. I feel young and frightened and stupid and out of my depth. I am emaciated - I can barely eat, I can barely walk.

I have been reading books and everything I can find online regarding addiction and trying to ""rehabilitate"" myself but I find it is my impulsivity and boredom that is dangerous. I no longer enjoy using the coke and vow each time will be the last, however I seem to forget that I do not enjoy it and my boredom takes over completely - urges to self harm, urges to blow thousands of dollars (I am in debt, predictably). Bipolar disorder and substance abuse runs greatly in my family. I don't know how to stop doing coke. All I want in my life now is to settle down, get my degree, get a job, have a baby with my boyfriend who is doing everything he can and is desperately worried. I want to stop but I am compulsively doing it. Please help me",1612461271

My 17 yo sister is addicted to meth.

I keep reading meth destroys your life and the life of your loved ones, but I don't think my sister will do anything about it, she doesn't wants to do therapy and basically just wants to end her life and get high in the meantime. I want her to be alive and healthy and happy, but I don't know how. It's hard to know she might die because of meth. I read that in this situations you should run away because the addiction is basically hell for the family and being around is like approving her behavior. I don't want to see how my sister wastes her life in that shit, but I don't want to abandon her either.

If newdazeduser is reading this tho - thanks dude.


What an amazing story! 

Really cool of you to share as I can relate at least partially. It's rare to see someone being objecive about drugs - usually it's the extremes - either ""drugs are hell, only dirty junkies do it, eww"" or ""fuck yeah, drugs rule!"" (some variations in the middle e.g. ""weed/shrooms are ok, but the rest (synthetic stuff) is satan's pus-filled asshole."").

I'm not in the same shoes for sure (meaning I'm not pretending to fully relate), but got a similar thing with speed/coke. I'm an addict for approx. 5 years now and can legit say that doing speed at work has helped a lot (not to mention free time - video games, parties with friends, sex/wanking being 3x more pleasurable etc) - I already kinda love what I do, but with speed I was confident (in a non-arrogant way), productive, had fun doing mundane shit and had ideas that pass the scrutiny of sober-me with flying colors. I'm hiding it well of course and I'm making 10-15x the minimum salary in my country, which I appreciate with total gratefulness. But I also know it's (the drugs) destroying my life in a slow-but-sure downslide- way.

Had a 6 month pause recently (I'm 31, it was like a year ago) and I literally want to cry thinking about it - I was truly, profoundly happy for the first and only time in my life. Not that I'm all gloom n doom in general (I mean I am kinda, but not in public lol) but I do lean more on the depression/shit self esteem side of things). Not just euphoric - joyful, calm, confident, working out, waking up at 6am w/o an alarm etc.

Now I'm using again for a year approx - this time its not weekly 3-day binges (no food, no sleep at all) and then a horrible comedown - this time it's daily use with eating and sleeping in between (obv less than normal) and I'm kinda scared it's gonna be so much harder to get out this time even tho I don't reach the crazy highs as for the 3 years before the 6mth thing. I can kinda see it's mark on my face too - I'm starting to look really tired.

I am planning on taking a 3 day vacation next week just so I can come down and wallow in my head-shit in peace. I guess I just wanted to share and maybe if anyone has any tips, I would really appreciate it (I do have a narcologist (is that the word?) and am planning on therapy.

Hope y'all are having a great day (or at least bearable), much love!",1612469284
The last hangover. Is it okay to play video games? Is it a normal or close to normal chemical cascade?,5,lccqhs,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lccqhs/the_last_hangover_is_it_okay_to_play_video_games/,7,"Hello,

Tim hopes nobody finds who he really is. But without a resource like a licensed therapist or in patient center, has no choice but to get some kind of feedback.

Tim is 31.25 years old. His parents married and divorced when he was young. his mom had custody for a while; they moved around a lot. went to 3 different high schools, and 2 different middle schools, all private. freshman year hs was spent in a different country in a boarding school, in northern france an hour away from brussels, lille.  he grew up and befriended mostly white, upper class folks.

up until he came back from france, he was a clean person. he used to step on cigarettes on the floor and crack the tobacco out because he thought they were bad. when he returned to the us, he lived with his grandparents. he also played sports, basketball and football, rarely got sick, an otherwise healthy human with the clean slated potential to live to age 80. there wasn't any supervision because his gparents were old, he was very lonely, and most of his human contact was over the internet via AIM and multiplayer video games like counter strike and starcraft. he started smoking cigarettes during this time, so if anyone asks and has an issue with 420, the shit that's LEGAL and AVAILABLE are the real culprits, alcohol included.

not long after, he started smoking weed, age 15. hes been using weed since then, and it's never caused him any problems. his  memory seems to still be in tact and he never get sick, hes otherwise still healthy but he want to keep it that way because he will not  get any other chances after this.

he thinks this lonliness perpetuated through high school because of moving around a lot and having to ditch old friends and make new ones, but he also had a lot of other problems with himself like the way he looked and where he was from and things that he considers now to be, unimportant or, unrelated to a person's success. in other words, his brain didn't really start developing into an adult one until, about a year ago when he stopped using drugs. so his guess is that the drug use at the start of adolescence impeded his natural development. so all the above led to an interest of using drugs, he thinks stumbling on [erowid.com](https://erowid.com) browsing the internet probably reading up on things about weed, and then reading about the effects of all these drugs.

during high school from 16-18 he did ecstacy 3 times, mushrooms 5 times, lsd 3 times, and coke 10 times.

coke was the one that perpetuated the most. from 18-21 he did it a handful of times with a friend, maybe 3 times max, low doses as well under half gram. then when he was 21 in college, stumbled on poker, and got addicted to gambling. hes clean from gambling for 2 days. gambling produced a high greater than any of the drugs he had ever done, including high doses of cocaine, so from 21-25.50 he was completely clean from cocaine and all drugs. all he did was play poker online, losing, because in gambling the odds are against the player; how the game is designed. then from 26-30 the use went from once a month, to once a week, to 3 times a week, until January of 2020. He relapsed a handful of times throughout the year, incessantly trying to control the cravings.

cocaine and gambling cost him several jobs, his 20s, ten years of lifespan, and possibly more if he get disease later in life from it.  therefore, Tim would rather not be alive, than ever go back to these behaviors. they are no different to him, brain chemistry wise in memory and the hippocampus and everything, than causing lethal harm to yourself. from his experience, relapse is what prevents a person from ever being free. hes 100% sure hell never relapse on gambling or drugs. his brain has finally understood, schematically, that the above behaviors are fake, illusory, and unnatural. our brain chemistry is the result of millions of years of evolution; Tim doesn't want to ever fuck or tamper with it ever again, and has developed a DEEP respect for himself that never existed before in his life, which is what led him to these behaviors in the first place.

If you made it this far, my question is, based on the above history of use and drugs used, will Tim have a shot at physically restoring his brain chemistry to some modicum of normalcy? Having lost 10 years of his life to fake behaviors, can he still play video games. Do video games rank with these nasty things that exist, or is it a real form of dopamine release? Video games have never caused these kinds of problems. In tim's opinion, the worse they can do is take up a person's time.

Clean from smoking (cigarettes / dry weed): 1.1 years

Clean from cocaine: 1.1 months

Clean from gambling: 48 hours

Clean from all other drugs mentioned: 11 years

"10 Reasons Why You Should Cut Your Drug Addicted Parents Out Of Your Life, And Not Feel Badly About It",0,lckp74,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lckp74/10_reasons_why_you_should_cut_your_drug_addicted/,0,"Someone recently posted in another one of my addiction groups regarding whether they should walk away from their addicted parents or not. There was a lot of shaming regarding why they shouldn't, and how they should be expected to stick around. 

As the adult child of drug addicted parents, and an addict myself, I highly recommend not doing so. No one should be shamed for walking away from abuse. We don't do it to domestic abuse survivors, and we shouldn't do it to the adult children of addicts that choose their own health and well-being above being there for their parents. 

I wrote this piece with that in mind, of the ten reasons why you should in fact cut your drug addicted parents out of your life, and never feel badly about it. I hope it helps someone struggling with the same thing I once was with my own addicted parents. 

1.) It’s Them Turning Their Back On You, Not The Other Way Around

As difficult as it is to accept, the decision to walk away happened well before you made it yourself, by your parent(s), and not you. No one wants to cut their parents out of their life. I don’t care what the situation is, you are always going to feel a pull towards your parents. It is a preprogrammed survival instinct to have a need for your parents love and support. The problem is, as the adult child of drug addicted parents, you have to fight with your body and mind’s need for your parent’s love, and for your need for mental health and well-being at the same time. No parent that loves their children, should ever expect them to carry that burden, and make the choice between those two needs.

2.) You Shouldn’t Be Expected To Endure Abuse

We don’t expect domestic abuse survivors to endure abuse, so why should adult children of drug addicted parents be expected to do so? For some time, I did not want to let my parents go, because of the stigma that society places on us for turning our backs on our parents. We are taught to love and respect our parents at all costs, and if we decide to choose our own health above our parents, we are villainized for it by society. Yes, they may have given birth to you, but that does not give them the right to subject you to abuse, and it does not make you obligated to endure their abuse. I have been shamed many times for no longer allowing my toxic and drug addicted parents to abuse me, and it is a disgusting notion that I, or anyone else, should be shamed for choosing our own health and safety first and foremost. The strength that it takes to say goodbye to someone you love that is hurting you, is immeasurable, and should be commended, not condemned.

3.) You Need To Protect Your Own Family

I began using drugs at nine years old, administered initially by my parents, and it altered the trajectory of my entire life. My childhood was filled with toxicity that seeped into every aspect of my life, and flowed out into my adulthood. Enduring addiction and abuse has made me a better mother in the end, but that’s precisely why I won’t allow my parents to do the same to my own children as they did to me. Knowing what I went through as a child, I would never willingly put my own children in the same predicament I was in. My want and need to have my parents in my life, for their love, does not supersede my children’s right to a happy, healthy, and safe childhood and life. Neglect is a form of abuse, and it happens when you allow your children to be put in a situation that you know is toxic and unsafe for them. That is just not something I will allow for my children, and I won’t be shamed for it. I will protect my children at all costs, and if that means I have to let go of my drug addicted parents to do so, then so be it. I won’t alter the trajectory of their lives, in the way my life was altered. My mother once filled one of her many pill bottles full of pennies for my brother’s child, her grandchild, to play with as a rattle. There was no understanding on her part as to why this was disturbing, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to ignore it on my end.

sick of dumbass highschool kids,51,lbtwpd,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lbtwpd/sick_of_dumbass_highschool_kids/,38,"so, im a recovering drug addict, about 16. i started drinking and taking pills in about 5th grade, and things just spiraled from there. by 8th and 9th grade i was buying off of dealers from the ghetto in my city and was just doing some straight crazy shit. (cocaine, molly, painkillers, etc). i was stealing the little money my parents had to get all this stuff and did not give a single shit. i didn't care if i was destroying my body or not, i didn't even care if i died or not. eventually i was caught overdosing (on purpose, i was trying to commit suicide), was temporarily kicked out of school, and put in rehab. now im 366 days sober, and im proud to be in the place that i am. i understand that i am an addict, i understand that i won't be able to live a ""normal"" teenage life. but, quarantine has been really hard for me. everyday i wake up and just get more and more depressed. i feel like an eventual relapse is coming faster and faster, and i don't know how to stop it. it's been especially hard because i haven't been going to AA or NA meetings. i wanted to get my 1 year coin but can't because we don't have any meetings currently running in my neighborhood.

not only that but all these annoying ass kids in my grade are going around social media claiming that they are ""druggies,"" bragging about all the hard shit that they've done and how they're gonna die of an overdose. i don't know what exactly it is but something just makes me want to reach through the screen and slap these fuckass kids. ive struggled with addiction my entire childhood, and will struggle with it for the rest of my life. these kids act like they're these hard addicts and make it into some cool personality trait. to give you some perspective, these are like your average ""i don't give a fuck about school"" skater kids who pop xans all the time and act like they rule the world. it is so hard to be sober and see shit like this. these mfs act like they're hard as hell and are gangsters/drug kingpins, when in reality we live in a white suburb, and most of these kids have parents that make 250k+ a year.  part of me just wants to clock these kids in the face and tell them that they're living in a fairytale dream. it's so frustrating. i hate teenagers. i hate quarantine.

115 hours into sobriety,7,lc5uzq,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lc5uzq/115_hours_into_sobriety/,4,"For those of you that don’t want to do the math I am 5 hours shy of my 5th day not smoking any weed. If I would have slept 8 hours a night, that is 75 hours I have been awake, however iv only been sleeping roughly 4 hours every night so that adds up to about 90 hours iv been awake the last 5 days. Not an hour has gone by I don’t think about my old beloved drug, but my power of will has grow significantly. I will now get to the reason of my post. 

Today was probably the worst day of my life at least the worst day I can remember. It start off half way into my 8 hour shift at fire house subs. See, Iv had lower back issues the past two year and after a few doctor appointments, chiropractic adjustment, and even physical therapy nothing had helped me. I made a decision to go back to the doctor and push for x-rays. Well, I got my x-rays back and hearing the results on the phone(during my 30 min break)They told me something along the lines of.. I have a degenerative back disorder called  retrolisthesis that involved my s1 and s5 disk. I had no idea what any of this meant. Shortly after a few google searches I found my answer. It’s basically an injury that is un cure-able and mostly people are prescribed muscles relaxers, and injection of steroids in the lower back and in cases that neither of those help, surgery. I’ve lived every day the last 2 years in pain. The best way to describe it is I feel a sharp pain about 3- 4 hours a day that feels like a knife is being inserted into my lower back on my right side, the time the pain is manageable it feel more like a dull pain that is just annoying. I feel back pain every step I take, every time I stand longer then 5 min, any time I sit in a chair over 30 min (including driving), whenever I bend over or squat, even at times while laying down. Sitting in my car reading that I will live the rest of my life with lower back pain that even surgery and drugs won’t be able to take care of, I cried. (Btw I’m 21 years old the age of invincibility some say) But I had to get back to work and put my best smile on.( and I did )
I think in my brain iv know for a long time my back was never going to get better, but having the facts in front of my face was like being slapped in the face with ice water and metal hand. It hurt and I was shocked, sad and angry, plus not smoking weed made emotions pour out of me in 10 fold. Work wasn’t horrible neither was my day. But the realization of my back was enough to wipe every happy thought from my brain and make my day a living hell. 
I’m a great actor, could probably play in movie I’d say. None of my coworkers asked me what was wrong and I had cheery voice every time I talked to a customer. But behind that face showed the shadow of so many bad thoughts in my head.  Well the orthopedic doctor will call me next week for my first visit and hopefully what they do can help some of my pain. A lot of the time I smoked weed to forget about the pain but now I may be prescribe pain killers which I will not take under any circumstance. I have far to addicted of a personality to start talking those kind of pills. I will not smoke weed agin for the rest of my life I don’t care if it helps my pain, I feel like unemotional zombie that cares about little to nothing besides my own pleasure. I know that sounds sick but that is the person I am being addicted to weed. In these last 5 days iv experienced more emotion then iv felt in what feels like months( not good emotions) but emotions all the same and I missed them like I miss my half sister I haven’t seen in close to 8 years. I know I’m metamorphosing into the happy fun loving polite person I was before I smoked weed, and I won’t quit, it just hurts to know it will never be gone. 
I’m sorry this post is so long and sorry some of it is a little off topic for the group all the same if you had made it to the end of this please share your thoughts I would love it and it helps me stay sober.

I’ll be there for 45 days. I’m scared at the detox and withdrawal but there will be support stuff available around the clock which comforts me. 

My days will consist of individual and group therapy, reiki, yoga and meditation, art and music, journaling, reading, and other activities.

I’m done. (Part 2),2,lc8kr2,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lc8kr2/im_done_part_2/,0,"Hey, figured I’d make this a series since some of y’all enjoyed my honesty. Don’t know what I deserve for the attention but its been one of the small things getting me through this FUCKING withdrawal. 

Today’s been FUCKING horrid. I have been in writhing pain all day, I described it to my therapist as a beam of light that just needs to burst through my chest but is also infecting the rest of my body. Its been abysmal and I also slept through a doctors appointment where I could maybe have gotten some soboxone or something to deal with this shit but maybe its a sign. 

The voices in my head are back. I don’t suffer from schizophrenia or anything, but after doing hardcore drugs for this whole month and drinking for a year prior, its weird to actually think again. Having that constant voice saying shit, I don’t know how I’m gonna deal with it because that fucker is what got me into this in the first place. But its also the voice that sbows me how beautiful the world is. I live in such a beautiful neighborhood in America and I was just looking down my street seeing all the gas street lamps and thinking wow, what a beautiful sight.

I’ve spent the whole day watching Euphoria, a show where I’ve heavily identified with the main character. She’s a drug addict who is in a somewhat similar situation to me. I just graduated from college, with a honored degree in psychology. I still live in a world of parties, drug use, casual sex and intense socialization. This is one of the biggest fears of mine, since I don’t know how I’m gonna go to a social function again without using something to make it a lil easier. Not something to worry about now through, gotta focus on my sobriety and just existing before I can think about going to some party.

I was talking with my therapist about my life today and just thinking about why I despise myself so much. I don’t know where it comes from, because I know that I’m naturally a super caring and sweet human being. Maybe I’ve been faking it all these years just to gain approval and I want to know it deep down that I am good without doing it for others. 

I also talked about my absolute obsession with women and dating in general. This whole abuse cycle of 2020-2021 started with me breaking up with my ex. We had dated for 2.5 years as I may have talked about in my previous post but I can’t be asked to check. I have been searching for love for so long on dating apps for the past few months, and its legit one of the most important things to me. I don’t know why but all I fucking want in the world is to be held and told “I love you” probably that validation I seek since I don’t believe myself if I ever told me that.

Well I’m fuckin dead and don’t wanna think anymore tonight. I went to NA tonight for the second night in a row, and I’m proud of that. Wish me luck tomorrow since I think I may have to go to work but I may cancel if im fucking dying but I kinda hope I feel better so I can make some money.",1612445394

I just really want to know what the people of this community think because it’s really messing with my head and I don’t know if I should tell her I like her because I feel like that might guilt trip her into feeling sorry for me and when she likes someone new, the jealous part of me makes me hate the person to the bone so please I just need to know what to do and if I should tell her I like her.

I started taking them occasionally for pain and then they helped me sleep so I took them for that, then I realised how relaxed they made me feel and I continued taking them for that. Cut to now I’ve somehow gotten into the habit of taking them every day and I take more to cope with intense emotions instead of working through them, I find myself craving that feeling. The only thing stopping me from going onto considerably stronger opiates is that I know for a fact I would spiral quickly and ruin my life, it is however tempting and the thought is often in my mind. “you won’t let it spiral, just take a few and then stop”, “you won’t let it become a problem you have too much to loose”.

Moral of the story is even if you think it would never happen to you (I’ve had it easy, have a good life, good job, amazing family and upbringing) it absolutely can grab you and I can see how easy it is to fall down that rabbit hole.

What's addiction? What does it mean in terms of self-harm?

I was addicted. I use to require it to function, to escape, to cope. I had to, wanted to, needed to self-harm but it's not like that anymore. I use to crave it.

It's not like that anymore. Or that's what I keep telling myself.

But now twice in the past 8 months I've turned back. It was minimal both times, just a taste, I guess you could say. Just a small craving. 

The feeling creeping back that for some reason unknown to me at the moment, that I *needed* to. I could resist and resist and resist until at one point, I *couldn't*.

Does that mean I'm addicted? My day to day isn't overwhelmed by the desire to self-harm. My mind isn't drowning with thoughts of requirement. 


It's just sometimes, I have a temptation that I just *can't* resist.

I suppose if I slip into a continuous pattern like I have before then I would consider myself to be addicted *again* but am I already addicted now?",1612424677
I’m done. I’m going to finally do this. I’m terrified.,82,lbf8n3,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lbf8n3/im_done_im_going_to_finally_do_this_im_terrified/,15,"I’m sitting here writing this because I have no one else to talk to and I’m going through the emotional turmoil of Opiate withdrawl. Ive been on around 120mg of percoset per day for a little less than a month and drinking half a bottle to a bottle of whiskey a day for a few months before that. I’m so depressed and saddened by who I have become and I don’t know the real me anymore. I’m scared to take this journey again because I know that dealing with how truly miserable I am in my own skin is going to be an abysmal journey. 

I’ve been an addict all my life, but I remember drinking the champagne/wine from peoples glasses when people weren’t looking at dinner parties and events; I was 8 at the time. I started drinking and smoking in 7th and 8th grade respectively and ever since then I’ve done anything I can get my hands on. I went to rehab for prescription pill and weed addiction when I was in my early 20s and managed some semblance of sobriety until 2020.

In December of 2019, my long term girlfriend and I decided to split up amicably. We didn’t have anything in common overall and the relationship had soured but I definitely see now that she was the rock that held my sobriety together, instead of having me hold it together for myself. She didn’t use drugs or drink so it was easy to be around her and helped me cope with my addiction. After we broke up I went off the deep end and dived straight back into the world of addiction. Its obvious now that I was never really sober, I just was codependent. Now that I am alone, I have been chasing love ever since in some sick fantasy it will make me feel better about how much I truly despise living in my body.

The reason I used, personally, is to escape my horrifying anxiety and mental illness that has plagued me since I was 4 years old and I couldn’t sleep in my own bedroom because I was terrified of burglars. I have never felt safe around other people and I am constantly viewing myself from the third person when I am sober. Its so tiring and I just hate socializing without a drink or two and it gets actually fun when I get fucked up. This is what I worry about, what if I’m just meant to be this way. I don’t want to be this way and I don’t know how I’d ever truly accept myself as this person. I just wish I was fucking different. I wish I didn’t feel every fucking emotion so intensely to the point of insanity. I wish I had the ability not to so adamantly care about peoples acceptance of me. I just don’t know what to do anymore so I’ve started going back to NA today.

I don’t have 24 hours sober yet. Im still tapering off Percocet and I had a small glass of wine to deal with this horrible depression. Probably not the best thing to do but Its just so god damn hard right now. I feel so UTTERLY alone and miserable. I just wish I had someone here to hug me and tell me its all going to be okay. I am terrified for whats to come, I really am, but I know I will kill myself soon if I don’t get a handle on this. I’m at a breaking point and I don’t want to spend another year fucked up beyond belief. I love you all so fucking much, and thank you for giving me the courage to have some semblance of belief I can be happy.

He says it'll be years if we do get back. Our relationship ended so horrendously. He's an addict. He did so many cruel and mean things to me. Thing is... he does do them when high/drunk. When I do do a timeline in my mind I do see it. When he's been an asshole is when he was using or during. He says to look at that and make my decision on who he is. Outside those times.... I love him so mucb. He's wonderful. He wants me to be strong and is supportive.

I didn't help either because I am so resentful and carry grudges.  This probably hasn't helped him at all to his path of sobriety. I jist... Don't understand how someone can do such horrible things to people they love... I've neevr met an addict until I started to go out with my ex. I do love him amd I did feel he was the first man I ever actually loved in my life. I dreamed of a fututee with him, and him with me. But now things seem so horrible to the point that they may never be salavaged. But I want to try one more time... How many ""one more times"" have we had.. 

 But I've seen those bad sides so many times and it's blurred my perception of him....we fight so much now. I hold onto so much resent because of the things he's done(cheat, lie, steal, hurt  me,). He realizes he did these things and seems very regretful... And he was making improvements last year. He did mess up, but not as bad as other times but.. Should I look at this as him improving? I feel I beat him over the head for his last mistake before things really went to shit (he revealed he was chatting to women online. Given the worst things that  had happened, this is not too bad at all, but... It made me so sad and scared. As far as I know he neevr planned to meet up with them or send pics. He is bisexual and I gave him permission to make a dating site to explore his bi side and have sex with men. Guess since it was easy for him to also talk to women simce the option was right there). 

I just... Need advice from someone going through or has gone through addiciton on this situation.

(“It’s not you, it’s the cage you live in”)",11,lblxny,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lblxny/addiction_as_a_disease_model_a_fallacy_its_not/,13," Addiction being a disease, as in that you are cursed with it for life is a fallacy in my opinion.. Troops returning from Vietnam went cold turkey (suffered withdrawals, etc) and didn't crave more of the drug. If you give a lonely rat the choice between cocaine and water, it chooses cocaine, and it gets hooked. But if you give it a better environment, with other rats to socialise with, then it will choose to go back to the water and go through the withdrawals willingly. I read that in the book 'Biology of desire' .  Neuro-plasticity means that neural pathways change over time. People lose half there skull and brain in accidents, and parts of the brain, that were designated for other functions will recolonise and create new pathways to compensate for the jobs of the parts that were lost. Our brains are environment-dependant and will adapt. Massive changes are possible in our neural-pathways or neural-highways in some cases lol. 

Just my thoughts/ rant.

“It isn't the drug that causes the harmful behavior - it's the environment. An isolated rat will almost always become a junkie. A rat with a good life almost never will, no matter how many drugs you make available to him. As Bruce put it: he was realizing that addiction isn't a disease. Addiction is an adaptation. It's not you - it's the cage you live in.” ( Johann Hari (* 1979) British columnist, journalist, writer, Chasing the Scream. The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs , Bloomsbury, January 20, 2015 )

Memantine for cannabis withdrawal - any reports on this? Looking to curb the last crutch.,1,lbvqhm,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lbvqhm/memantine_for_cannabis_withdrawal_any_reports_on/,2,"Im looking for something to temporarily help ease cannabis withdrawal *without* forming a new dependency. I read a couple of different studies where Memantine showed potential in treating bipolar as well as withdrawal from stronger substances like heroin and opiates, so I’m curious to know if anybody has experience to share with using it as a sort of “bridge” to getting sober, who may also have bipolar disorder.

I've been a daily smoker for the past several years. I don’t enjoy smoking any more as it has a lot more negative consequences now like anxiety and paranoia for me, but at this point i smoke 1-2 times daily to avoid the multi week span of mood swings, loss of hunger, can’t sleep, irritability and potentially a reoccurrence in psychosis I have experienced several times trying to quit. I have used cannabis to initially medicate PTSD and Bipolar (BP1), but I have used cannabis & CBD relentlessly over the years to help me quit many other addictions I picked up like: cigarettes, alcohol and a long period where I was stacking opiates and benzos daily.

Needless to say, under all the drug abuse there is something deeply logged within that keeps me in a cycle of addiction. I need to heal and transform and I am not interested in escaping that reality any longer. I’ve quit everything besides cannabis thus far and I’m nearing my two year mark of being off of psych medications. I use a lot of breath work, meditation, running and periodic sessions of micro-dosing psilocybin to work through this shit, and I need to keep it up. But damn, cannabis withdrawal does not help me keep to this routine and neither does cannabis use. I have a good feeling about trying memantine to help temporarily, but I also can’t find any reports of success or failure with info relative to my interest for use specifically.

Anybody have experience with something similar? All input welcome and appreciated.",1612408928

 I'm a Ludomaniac.  I am 20 years old, I live in Kazakhstan.
 As an ordinary guy, I was interested in football, I had a favorite football team.  And at the age of 16 I will see my friends place bets in bookmakers.  Then I decided to try with them.  Save money on dinners in the canteen, put the money that my relatives gave me.  Everything was no offense.  But I got a taste.  I was constantly losing my pocket money at bets.  But then I had no problems, then I forgot about the rates.  When I was 18 I entered the capital of my country.  I wanted to go to a big city.  I had plans for the future, I wanted to become a programmer.  I had a great love for IT.  I could not enroll in a programmer, but I entered another profession to the brink (Completely free training).  I had a girlfriend who loved me very much, big ambitions for the future (I myself began to learn web programming).  Started working at Burger King.  But soon when the money appeared, I remembered about the rates.  I thought to save money, and live on the money earned on the rates.
 I lost every salary (It was not a big $) in the first days at the rates.
 I had constant money problems.  I hid everything from my girlfriend.  I started to take things to a pawnshop (laptop, phone). I took out a micro loan for $ 30, which then grew to $ 120.  Sometimes I won, but I didn't have this money for long.  I rarely went out with my girlfriend for a walk, because I hid that I had no money.  She thought I had lost touch with her.  Soon because of this, we parted.  I still think I'm a fool.  She loved, took care of me.  And I lost it for this problem.  The quarantine began, and I left for my hometown to my parents.  I have the most wonderful parents in the world and have always tried to be the best son.  They also did not know about the rates.  I started to work in the same way, but still I didn't play a lot.
 I have not paid the loan yet, so I renewed it every time (According to the conditions, I must pay the entire amount, or renew the term).  Parents asked where the things that I handed over to the pawnshop.  I lied that I left my friend in the capital.  I didn't have the money to buy the same laptop, so I started betting and losing again.  Now I am 20 years old, I told my parents that I would take my old laptop from a friend and come and look for a job as a programmer in the capital.  I am afraid to admit my mistake to my parents.  Now I am in the capital, pretending to be busy.  Now I understand where my life is going.  I'm scared.  All I want to end up with is this.  I hope I can find the money, buy a laptop, and be done with this for good.  If not for that.  Perhaps I would be with my girlfriend, get a job as a programmer and everything would be fine.  Maybe if I can finish it all this will work out.  But I have bad thoughts about how to get this money to finish with the bets. I am very afraid to upset my mother.  I even thought about the crime.  Fortunately, I immediately give up these thoughts.  Please don't ever repeat my mistakes.  If everything works out for me, I will definitely write about it.",1612376910
Heroin Is Stronger Than A Mother's Love,11,lbd8zk,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lbd8zk/heroin_is_stronger_than_a_mothers_love/,3,"Through the eyes of a formerly addicted mother, and also the daughter of the addicted, in half of my experience, heroin is stronger than a mother’s love.  

The way I remember my mother's hands, are extended, with a variety of pills in them for me to take. I was nine years old when I began ingesting a potent mix of narcotics under the guise of them being vitamins.


They say that there is nothing stronger than a mother's love. It is one of the oldest, most sacred, and widely agreed upon core beliefs, that there is nothing stronger than the bond shared between a mother and her child. I want to believe in the all omnipotent power of a mother's love like they do, and I would, if I'd never tried heroin before. I know that heroin is more powerful than the most sacred and innate primal urges known to man since the beginning of time. That should tell you something about the opiate epidemic, and the strength of those of us involved in fighting addiction and the war on drugs from the inside. I fought a beast whose power transcends the most powerful bond known to man, and I won, but my mother didn't. 

My childhood was filled with a mixture of hate disguised as love, and that's probably why I thought the man that nearly strangled me to death, actually loved me. As I ripped my fingernails out of their nail beds trying to pry his hands from around my neck, unsuccessfully, I wondered if he did it because he loved me. Even before the drugs were introduced into my childhood, and to my parents, I didn't have a positive environment at home, to say the least. When you're in an impossible and survivalist situation, your brain tells your body what you need to hear so it can keep going, so it can continue without fully collapsing, and so the outward shell of yourself left doesn't betray you into divulging the truth to the outside world. Probably one of the biggest testaments to an outward lie is that my parents' thirty plus year marriage is still intact, but then again so is the bullet hole lodged in the wall of my childhood home from where my mom fired a gunshot at my dad. The wall of my childhood home that it's lodged in is the one between my parent's bedroom and mine, and if you took a tape measurer down the middle, that bullet hole lines up nearly dead center down the bed I slept in as a child. 

My mother, like most, began taking narcotics for an accident, a fall she sustained on the ice while she worked as a nurse in an elderly home. That's when she began taking opiates, and so did I, unknowingly and at her behest. My mother found in the pills a numbness that drowned out these sickening truths that screamed inside her brain, and allowed her to continue living in the lie of domestic violence being love. I was just a casualty. 

I'm not sure why my mother began feeding me drugs. But I often wonder if she would have still done it if she could have fast forward the tape of that nine year old girl, her daughter, fifteen years into the future to have seen me overdosed and lifeless on the floor of a dopehouse in the Baltimore ghetto with a needle in my arm, and being narcan'ed back to life at twenty-four. Scar above my eyebrow from the previous night's withdrawal seizures, one of which was into the shards of glass from a mirror I shattered on the way down. The day I was resurrected from death, I hadn't even showered from the previous night, and if I had passed, the paramedics would have found me bloody, scarred, and with a needle in my arm, dead from a fatal dose of heroin. Hey mom, look at me now!

I’ve been an addict for about 8 years now. For the past 5 it’s been mainly Benzos and painkillers. I went to rehab November 2019 and got clean for maybe 6 months. Once the pandemic started I stopped going to treatment and I ended up using again. It hasn’t been as bad as it has been in the past but I think that’s because I don’t have steady income right now. Whenever I get a little bit of money I buy Xanax with it. I think about saving it and sometimes I do for a day or two but then my anxiety gets to me and I give in. Even though I’m not taking it as much as I used to I’m still feeling myself slowly wasting away. I’m not eating right. I’m not doing anything with my life. I feel sick most of the time. And the constant anxiety and panic Every single has just built up and now I’m realizing I have trouble doing anything. I should be seeing a psychiatrist and I need to get to the doctor because I’m having problems with my heart and I can’t push myself to make a phone call to get an appointment because I just overthink it. It sucks because even though I know taking a Xanax won’t help me in the long run I can’t shake the thought that if I just take one the uncomfortableness and the panic will go away. I feel like it’s gonna end up killing me and if that doesn’t then the anxiety will just slowly eat away at me. Ether way I feel fucked and I don’t know how I’m every going to be able to function.

How can I support them without shaming them?**

&#x200B;

Someone who I care for very deeply seems like they might be struggling pretty seriously with addiction. For context, they are someone I dated in the past in the past and kept in touch with over the years after. We recently started up our relationship again, however they had to move away for a few months because of the pandemic. We are in our early 20's. 

Anyways, we talk pretty frequently, and lately they have been telling me they are drinking and using drugs everyday (I think mdma or speed but idk, I know they don't smoke weed) and it seems like its effecting their life a lot.  I know they have a history of addiction in their family. I know this isn't new, and seems like something that's been going on for over a year, but I haven't been consistent enough in their life to really tell until now. 

Today they sent me a message saying they've been getting drunk and high multiple times a day and avoiding their homework. Before the pandemic they were one of the hardest working people I've ever met, and are very successful in school and the art world. 

I don't really know how to interact with them around this because of my position to them and my personal history.  I was very anti drug growing and would stigmatize and shame people, but I've learned a lot since then about harm reduction and drug positivity, and even use them recreational once or twice a year. I don't want to shame this person and I want them to be able to trust me and confide in me. I used to shame my mom from smoking cigarettes' and to this day she still try's to hide it from me even when I say I don't care.  I really don't want to repeat that with this person. I don't judge them or think less of them at all and I don't want to make them feel shameful. At the same time I just don't really know what to say because often when they send messages it feels like a cry for help. It's happened a few times where they reach out when they're using and just randomly tell me about frequency and say they are spiraling and have been drunk every day for a week. 

Anyways, I really love this person, like even outside our romantic relationship I really really care about them and am worried. I still am unsure if its my place to step in and say ""this is a problem"" if they don't see it that way.

I want to numb myself with drugs so bad,4,lb6ppw,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lb6ppw/i_want_to_numb_myself_with_drugs_so_bad/,4,"I hate my existence. I feel so alone. I hate where I am. What have I done? The last months have been so hard. It's like things just got worse and worse. Now I'm sitting in this empty, cold and too expensive apartment and I am to blame. I moved here. What have I just thought? I hate where I live. I have no family, no friends. I just can't take this anymore; I don't know how to cope anymore. My therapist is useless in this regard. I can't afford to move again; also finding this flat was a horrible 4 months long process. 

I feel like I've done it all wrong. I trusted the wrong people, I didn't trust myself. I am so fucking alone and I have been for so long. I don't see my purpose in life. I am so done, I feel like I'm losing my mind completely. What have I done? I could have moved somewhere else but my narcissistic ""dad"" hold me back from doing so. Why did I even involve him? I  feel so stupid. I cannot stand myself anymore. 

That's why I want to sleep forever on benzos or take ritalin so I'm too hyper to worry. I won't return to coke and alcohol because I know that will be my end (honestly I just hate the comedown and the price of coke). 

TLDR: I feel alone and stupid. I hate the decision I made to move in this apartment. It's cold and empty and too expensive. I'm running out of money. I hate myself because I cannot stand my existence anymore. I don't know what the fuck I've done. I am to blame for my decisions; I feel like I'm incapable of living. That's why I want to return to drugs.

To Have A Heart That Still Beats (an original poem i wrote about addiction and sobriety),8,laziv4,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/laziv4/to_have_a_heart_that_still_beats_an_original_poem/,4,"
barebone feelings,
remedied with lines of oxycodone,
done off my phone.

i was drowning and nobody saw,
nobody noticed before the fall.
white lines of cocaine spelled out my name,
but i still forgot what it meant to be me.

swallowing words, dizzy and drunk, trying to forget about the violent memories that live inside this body, my body. whiskey puts me to sleep, a silent lullaby

the fentanyl gave me a reason to forget that i was losing control. 
i didn’t have to watch the downfall.
the drugs made me see the skies instead of the bottom of the cliff,
but only sent me further down 

to be sober is to have to pay attention when i bleed,
but to be lucky i still have a heart that pumps blood,
that beats,
and know that i am not another statistic of the epidemic, 
that drugs weren’t the reason for my life ending.

to be sober is to hope, every day, that i do not go back to drugs no matter what curveball is thrown toward me 
to resist all temptation to go back.
what seems like a good time one moment will certainly lead to another fall.

A new experience,2,lb94eh,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lb94eh/a_new_experience/,0,"First, I sincerely apologize if I have no right to be posting here for advice. 
I've been dating a man whom is a relapsed alcoholic.
He was upfront with me about his issues past when we started dating, but the last ~2 months he hit a major backslide due to personal issues. 
The difference in him is quite shocking to me. It breaks my heart because I truly care about him. I also lost my mother to alcoholism.
We're not so deeply connected that I couldn't just walk away. But I can't bring myself to do it at this point. And I'm well aware that a change is not something I can force on him, though I do encourage any comments he makes about quitting alcohol, and offer to help anyway I can (I.E. working out together, etc.).
My question is, how should I tread in the meantime? He's not very vocal about his feelings like I am, and I certainly don't want to make him feel worse than he may already.

Triggering Friends,2,lb7gqw,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lb7gqw/triggering_friends/,4,"\*\*\*I recently was prescribed Vyvanse so apologies if this post is jumbled\*\*\*

I have been clean from cocaine for four months. In fact, I hate cocaine now. It ruined any good that my life had to offer in a matter of months. Plus, it gave me nothing but extreme anger because even a heavy amount didn't offer the high that I was seeking. I am happy to say that my life is slowly improving thanks to the efforts of myself and my doctors. 

I need advice on how to handle a situation with a friend. She uses cocaine casually, but loves to bring it up frequently while very much so glamorizing the drug. I know that NA recommends not being around people, places, or things that are linked to your DOC, but I really only used with this friend a handful of times. Although, she has done blow around me a few times since I got clean. This weekend, she said something along the lines of ""I can't wait to turn into a drug addict"" after saying ""I just want to rail some lines in a dirty bathroom"". I know these are just dumb comments, but they really trigger some dark thoughts deep in me. I haven't been able to stop thinking about them.

My problem isn't even the coke anymore (like I said, even the thought of it brings up extremely negative emotions), but my drug seeking tendencies in general. My (irrational) thought process is to find a different drug, a drug that would make me feel even better than cocaine once did.  My mind seems to go toward meth, because I love uppers, or heroin, because I have a lot of exposure to it. I don't want to ruin my life but I don't know what to do. If I want something, I can find it. I went back to NA for the first time in awhile, but I swear those meetings only make me want to pick up more. My friend seems to not understand the absolute hell I went through while using and trying to get clean even though I try to vocalize my struggles. Fuck, drugs are still always on my mind. I'm not trying to control what she talks about, but how can I let her know that the way she talks about drugs compromises my fragile state of sobriety? Posting this to r/addiction because none of my other friends are addicts who know addiction firsthand. This might seem like a small thing but it's really scaring me.",1612331163

It gives me unrest
Constant boredom I receive
And nothing I get 
I long for a moment
When I escape this pattern 
Of rising and falling
Of going and leaving

I met new people
I have new friends
This mundane I have had 
is coming to an end
I see the light at the end 
I see the boredom fade
The tools I love
Yet my thoughts are telling me to stay

Time has passed 
I feel more alive 
Everyday is spontaneous 
Nothing is a pattern
There are tools you can use to alter your mind
It makes me even more alive
But I am often guilty
I seem to miss the mundane
I don't know why 
I hated that place

Friends are not Friends
Tools are Knives
Why did I leave the Mundane 
I can’t explain why 
I wanted an out 
Now I want in

Yet again time has passed 
The mundane is not mundane 
It is light and freedom 
It is everything I ever wanted
Why didn’t I just stay there
Even though I am back
I have forever left a mark 
As someone who has seen the abyss

The Mundane is life 
The Mundane is takes strength
The Mundane is Constant 
The Mundane is Fluid

The abyss intrigues

There is no other way to describe why someone would behave this way. I decided on my own accord to loss my job, loss my opportunities for future professions, my money, my relationships, all of it for loving someone. Wanting to be with someone. I ended up falling in love with someone that clearly stated “I don’t want to fall in love” “I don’t love you”. I am not sure why, but I did. We are codependent I am pretty sure. I give her love and comfort, she gives me illusion, hope. We live together, share a bed, sexual relations, but no commitment. How can you blame her, I fucked up and out of fear never mentioned my past with other women, lied about it. I didn’t want t to be an obstacle. We have good days, and terrible horrible days. I have been kicked, bitten, scratched, hit, punch, chocked. Still, I love her. I can’t think on life without her. She has her own problems. She has a dependency on social media, to be specific on dating apps. She loves the thrill of flirting with someone and if they are cute enough, having a sexual encounter with them. She is open to me about it in a way, the fact that I can see the constant notifications about her riske photos on those apps is a dead giveaway, and she knows that I know. It is slowly killing me. Every day, with every “I want to lick your titis” message I get a glimpse of my souls dies a little inside. I feel like less of a man, less of a human.

Im gonna try to keep this short. 

Long story short. I was prescribed 10 mg ir adderalls in the 11th grade when i was 17 years old. 

Im 21 years old now and I’m quite addicted. 

I abused the fuck out of them. 

My doctor cut me off in my 1st semester of college and since then I havent given it up. I would keep buying them. Non stop. And that made it worse. 

I would smoke weed every night and come back up every morning with adderall. 

I am a real estate broker. I know its who I am meant to be. But the adderall fucks me up. I am on speed every second and I am disconnected. I feel very socially off. 

I know its in me to be a negotiator and a communicator but adderall took my voice away a long time ago. 
Ive ruined relationships and gotten very angry at times.  And right now i dont know what to do. 

When i am on it
I get hand shakes. 
I make these faces i cant control. 
I always feel cracked out. 
Any time i stop, it only lasts a week because i just feel so scared to go to work without it. 
Any time i would go to work off adderall i would hide in a room where nobody could find me

But when i am on adderall im also just counterproductive 

Its time to stop

But it kind of feels like ive ruined myself. 

My jaw feels tight and it clicks if i want it too

Its really hard to communicate
 
I have this puzzled look on my face all day. 

Please , Honestly, am i fucked up forever?

I honestly walk around depressed everyday but i wouldn’t just have hope. I beleive in my self. 
But now things are getting scary. 

Can i become who i am meant to be or is there permenant damage done here ?

Searching for services/program to help me is proving difficult. There aren't many options and what I found are overwhelmingly oriented for men and not women. I found 2 programs - one was in Arizona and cost $60k for 45 days!

Im based in PNW but willing to travel for a program if needed.

I am seeking advice about my older brother and what is wrong with him. I think it may be hard drugs but I don’t know for sure. He was always such a charismatic and confident boy who grew up with aspirations of being a professional hockey player. He was attractive, popular and loved by many. When he didn’t make it, he fell into the party scene where I know he dabbled with party drugs and went to music festivals. He was using mdma and cocaine frequently. He may have been abusing cocaine as he works in the food service industry and that is rampant there. However, when he was about 22 I noticed things change for the worse. The main thing that struck me was his eyes. Usually so bright, blue and full of life, they had become dark, grey and soulless. Recently, his teeth have become dark and rotten, making me think he’s on something worse. I only visit home periodically due to school and every time he seemed to be worse and worse. I noticed he became highly agitated and almost paranoid with his shifty eyes. He can never sit still. The only time he seems relaxed is when he is drinking. And I know he’s struggled with drinking. At its worst, he could consume a 2’6 of vodka and seem fine to an onlooker. He also smokes weed. I don’t think either of these are the main issue. His personality slowly changed, once friendly and full of life to now dark and twisted. He seems to be in so much pain. He is extremely volatile, snapping at anyone who tries to offer help or support. He’s cut ties and said horrible things to every member of our family, usually unprovoked. His reaction to something mundane is bizarre. He’s quit drinking now for almost a year, but his behaviour is almost worse. He is so angry at everyone and everything. We just don’t know what to do. One of the last times I saw him was around Thanksgiving and he was euphoric, talking about the secret to life and how he’s on a “frequency higher than most people and understands things on a different level”. He gets into these moods which don’t seem to last. He was so weird he wouldn’t let anyone else talk, he was just ranting and in his own world moving around the room very animated. This made me believe he was on some sort of stimulants. Then I saw him again a few months ago and that’s when he snapped saying he didn’t want to speak to any of us again, that he hates us and that we’re all fake. We’ve never done anything to receive this kind of treatment. He goes through periods where he’s insanely healthy and gets super fit then 6 months later he’s drinking 2L pops and eating all day and night. I’ve thought maybe he is bipolar... but he’s never seen a professional, despite pleas from numerous people. I just want him to see a psychologist. But he won’t. We are all so worried about him and just want the old him back but I don’t know if he even exists anymore. It’s so heartbreaking...

Addicted to cocaine for over 12 months.  Started socially,  then started doing it at home on my own (if I had some left over I obviously didn't want my high to end). Lockdown kicked in. Became dependent on it. Helped me through days of nothing, not knowing and just general shit. Parents found out, got help but September to December last year I couldn't go more than 8 days without it. Fell into a hole between Christmas and New year. Never thought I'd be a person who couldn't leave my house out of fear. Started 2021 good. Clean. 17 days. Longest time since last Jan. However I had holidays to use up so currently in the middle of 12 days off work and well,  relapsed.  Over and over. Got paid on 25th. I now have £7 to my name. Not sure why I've done relapsed. Boredom, habit, my mind is completely gone. Not sure where to go from here.
The high from the current stuff I'm getting is unreal, the emotional damage I am doing is damaging. A circle. I am just frustrated with myself. My parents paid off nearly 10k for me and I pay them every month, but I just can't stop. I am scared. I don't know how to cope or go on. I'm afraid of how I will cope with situations in the future. I'm afraid of how people will react if I tell them my situation. Covid has been hard enough on all of us,  admitting I am addicted to cocaine is one of the biggest struggles of my life.  I just can't address it.",1612189025
Just wanted to share a small victory after being one year sober.,62,l9jbdt,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l9jbdt/just_wanted_to_share_a_small_victory_after_being/,16,"Hello everyone,

I still have a long road ahead of me, but I wanted to share something. Last year, I overdosed twice. In the last few years, I fell in love with percocets, cocaine and bathsalts. At the height of my addiction, I was using all three on a weekly basis. I was living in a fantasy world. Lost all my friends, flunk out of school. My family begged me to get help and I refused to listen. I have lived with depression my whole life and drugs showed me pure bliss. Pure happiness (but everyone knows this is a lie) My last overdose forced me to choose between addiction or recovery. I chose to give myself a fighting chance.

The road to recovery has been hard. Lots of sleepless nights. The cravings(sometimes I get them so bad I start to pray out loud). And the boredom! The feeling of wanting to have fun but you just cant. Because you're not interested in anything(not even food). Sometimes I feel like I wont make it.

I wanted to share with you guys that this morning, I opened my box full of vintage toys. (I havent opened this box in 3 years). Just for context, as a kid I collected a lot of japanese trinkets. (I have over 100 of them). It was the only thing that brought me joy as a kid. I slowly started to lose interest in them as I got older and forget about them completely when I fell into drugs. 

Right now I am taking them all out of the box and arranging them on a shelf. I feel like I felt simple happiness for the first time in years. My friends will probably wonder why the hell I have so much toys in my room now lol.

I’m living proof you can succeed at this. ❤️,17,l9nxe9,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l9nxe9/im_living_proof_you_can_succeed_at_this/,6,"Today I am one year clean so I’d just like to be a voice of encouragement to others. I was as badly hooked as one could be and lost everything due to my addiction. I hit my personal rock bottom way later than I should have, but that is also proof that it’s never too late. Fighting for your recovery isn’t easy, but overtime gets much simpler. Your life can be so much better than you could even imagine at this moment if you’re still in active use. Try anything to get better! What do you have to lose by trying? What works well for one may not for another and that’s the beauty of having more options today than we ever historically had. Most detox & treatment centers accept most insurance plans including government funded insurance. A.A. & N.A. meetings are readily available whether in person or via Zoom. If that’s not your thing, there are usually plenty of other alternative meetings depending on where you live. Suboxone clinics are popping up all over the U.S. Many facilities treat dual diagnosis. Always support on this particular site. Most churches and spiritual centers offer either addiction groups or individualized counseling. If I can do it, you can do it. Please believe in yourself.

Losing it with poly drug abuse,4,l9w5cj,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l9w5cj/losing_it_with_poly_drug_abuse/,2,"Losing it with poly drug use

I have so many drugs at my disposal. I used to use just a couple times a week to help my anxiety around social situations. It was fine for awhile but now when I’m sober I’m depressed and anxious. Also having depersonalization. I don’t know who I am anymore I feel worthless. 

Even when I’m on drugs I can’t feel good about myself anymore. I don’t know what drug my body is needing that makes me feel so bad. 

It’s such a complicated situation. Poly drug abuse isn’t really studied much and I thought by using different drugs I wouldn’t get addicted to one. Or it’s just that so many bad things have been happening in my life and my depression is so strong that drugs don’t help anymore. 

I know I need to just quit it all but I wont be able to go out with friends and do things that are enjoyable for a long time which will make me more sad. 

I’ve quit weed and nicotine which I was using everyday and I guess it helped with the anxiety but the depersonalization is still real. 

I can’t even enjoy normal things even on drugs. 
I’m just looking to see if anyone has had a similar situation and can share their experience. I can’t really talk to anyone without them treating me like an addict.

Edit. Idk Id I should just stick to the same drug everyday so that at least my brain isn’t confused with so many different drugs. Maybe that will work then try to quit that drug slowly.",1612187386

After I relapsed, I thought that my addictive brain from 4 years ago would come back right away. But it didn't! The reason (I think) that's cool is that you can truly recover from addiction in a lot of ways, it just takes time! 

I was able to pick myself back up and dust myself off because of all of this strength I had gained. I don't want to live that life anymore. My brain is well and my mind is clear. I know I can keep going.",1612173360

I'm so worried and angry and I want to shake him until he choses life because despite 10 years of preparing for it I am not willing or ready to lose my little brother! 

But I can't even go to him, as they don't allow any visitors in emergency. So I'm just crying on my couch, uselessly.

My dad passed away June of 2016 I had just turned 21, I always tell myself it’s not because of that but things slowly started going downhill after that. I had been with my boyfriend at the time since mid 2015, around September/October of 2017 I did Xanax. I had done it before back in December 2014, I was doing it quite a bit, all my friends around me were doing it for fun so I knew exactly who to get it from, I was getting like 7 for $30 so I was like wtf hell yeah, I would give 1 or 2 to my friend if I seen him around & then have the rest for me. I would drop them in a shot and take them, crush them up in my drinks and do it that way, I even snorted them wtf? But I stopped after about 1 1/2 months, fast forward to 2017. My bestfriend at the time had just got her own place a couple months prior & me and my bf at the time would go over there to hang out when we had time. One day I had ran into an old friend over there who I somewhat had a small thing with back in 2010 (keep in mind I’m currently 25) and he did xans & sold them, he ended up giving me one for free. I hadn’t felt that way in so long it was amazing. After that whenever I could go over to my friends place I would, and if he was there I was doing xans. It eventually led to me cheating on my bf at the time with him. I ended up doing xans more and more and eventually I broke up with my bf at the time (we had other problems prior to any of this, the Xanax just made it easier for me to break up with him because I couldn’t remember shit). I continued to be involved with my old friend & I was doing it more & more. It got to a point where I tried smoking a perc 30 with him. Eventually things ended with him but the xans didnt. I still had people around me doing it and I ended up getting involved with the person I was getting it from at the time, so then it was basically free to me. I was taking like 3 at the minimum a day. Didn’t care who I was with or who I was around as long as I had it. After things ended with him, I had this other longtime friend who ALSO was doing and selling it, we ended up hooking up and then all we were doing was xans day and night sitting in his room. (I pretty much sound like a whore at this point but I’m just tryna tell the story don’t judge 🤦🏻‍♀️ lol) everybody around me was on it or selling it, AGAIN. It was just the thing at the time and if you weren’t doing it or selling it what were you doing type of thing. There were times I had went off on my family & my family is the closest thing to me, nothing like that had ever happened before. I had gotten so many people to do it with me for “fun”. Anytime I wasn’t doing it I was having withdrawals, cold sweats, throwing up, super paranoid, it was just absolutely horrible. But what gets me to this day is that through all of that, because that wasn’t even everything, but through all of that in that short time, my family nor friends (ones who weren’t on it), not one person came to me concerned, none of them ever asked me if I was on something, none of them asked anything, and even after the fact to this day it’s never been mentioned. My family has never brought up that point in time, never asked if I had a problem with something, almost as though it didn’t happen? When I think about it now, like how I felt when I was doing it I almost miss that feeling. I don’t know. I’m not sure what I feel, I’m not really looking for an answer but more so just trying to express my thoughts that I’ve never really let out.",1612162408

I've been with my boyfriend for 4.5 years now. It seems like he can get sober and keep it up for about 6 months max. Most of the time he just detoxes on his own. This last time, he got into a treatment program but it's kind of a joke. Most places either want to preach jesus or just throw some pills at you or both. The place he's at now was supposed to have some sort of programs available, but they kept pushing it back or signing off on it without ever having any meetings. They want him on pills for 3 years. I know he needs actual therapy - from an actual therapist that has personal experience. He doesn't think anyone understands and wants someone to talk to face to face. I'm apparently no help (that's fine, I can accept being useless in this regard) It's just excuse after excuse though. Lie after lie... We've made some progress over the years on how we both deal with it. Basically though, the area we live in is small. We both have healthcare through the state and it's something but isn't great. I don't know how to find a decent therapist and I'm not sure how hard he would try on his own. I suggested online therapy and he didn't seem into it even though I know he'd have a better chance of finding a more compatible person. I don't even know that I have a specific question, but I don't want to keep doing this every 6 months. He doesn't seem to think it has any effect on anyone but himself. Idk. I guess is there some sneaky list of decent therapists/counselors that can get him out of being mentally stuck in this loop? I think if he could figure out how to process stress and emotions better he would have more of a chance at success next time. In my experience with talking to others, it takes a while to find the right therapist. We aren't rich and covid makes it harder to get into anywhere. He's only a few weeks back on now and idk how long he'll be able to stay in the program he's in now if they find out.",1612158194

My main addictions are weed, caffeine, nicotine, porn. Also dealt with addiction to some harder downer and stimulant drugs. Mostly managed to stay off those though.

I try to quit all of these and I just go absolutely insane and relapse every time. For the past years I've been trying to quit. For the past weeks I've been making it one day then it gets so intense I cannot go any further.

I need the caffeine to function. I need the weed to relax and sleep at night and fuel my creativity. I need the nicotine to just get me through the day. And I compulsively watch horrible genres of porn because of how deep my addiction with it has gotten.

I'm ready to be done with this vaping, smoking, speeding. I'm ready to be free of addiction. But years have went by of attempting to quit. Here I am, 18 now. Been addicted since 13 and also dealt with addiction to harder drugs. Which I've relapsed a few times on but have not used daily like my main drugs of choice.

I feel so trapped. Like I'm just stuck in the cycle and there's no way out.

I tried only quitting nicotine but the withdrawals were soooo intense I couldn't dare make it through. Along with that, caffeine and weed triggers cravings and so does porn oddly enough.

I tried only quitting caffeine. Again, went insane and could not do it. I tried only quitting porn. But yet again, caved in because when I'm high I get cravings for porn.

I tried only quitting weed. But my insomnia and boredom drove me near crazy... yet AGAIN.

"Encouragement, you can get through it",4,l8wods,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l8wods/encouragement_you_can_get_through_it/,0,"Hi,

**What is this about? Weed addiction.** 

I struggled with weed addiction. It went on for 9 years, and it stole my ""best"" years (20s) away from me. At least that's how I thought of it at the time. 

However, it was a learning curve. It led me to all sorts of religious study, psychology, meetings, resources, medications and more. I grew as a person, both academically and spiritually through my struggle to fix my disease. 

**The scale and source of the problem**

Was it inherited? I don't know. But I damn know anything I pick up that gives me even a slight bit of dopamine, is something my body then attempts to double down on and can easily become my heart and minds' sole desire. Weed just so happened to be the killer desire for me. 

I had previously stopped sometimes for 1 month, sometimes for 6 months. Always I smoked every day when I was not on a ""break"" (because at the time, I was in that state of wanting to stop but not knowing how). 

I was inhaling 2-3g a day into my previously clean lungs (I regret ever contaminating them), for perspective, sometimes 4g if it was a particularly bad day or there was a party. It was rough. thats north of 900g (roughly £6-7k IDK) a year easily. I spent more money on that, than any other thing other than rent, for those 9 years. It ruined relationships, opportunities, and even things that are intangible that I had no knowledge of that I missed because I was too wrecked to even be present. 

**What worked for me and how I understand addiction personally**

I now firmly believe that addiction is genetic and has spiritual components to it. God saved me, He can save you too - and is practically solely the reason I was able to overcome what I believe to be a spiritual battle, but many will claim it isn't, but trust me, the person I am on drugs versus the person I am now, are polar opposites, and definitely, they changed my state of consciousness from my normal to an abnormal one. 

Drugs filled a void in my life. I had PTSD from car accident when I was younger, and a few other bad situations that thankfully I survived, but not without mental scarring. I think that, finding alcohol, I found weed to be more ""chill"" and I preferred the version of ""me"" I was getting with weed, not alcohol. Truth is though, I was never the version of ""me"" that I wanted to be, even with those ""solutions"" that I had tried. 

**Any practical advice?**

Start by recognising it is a significant disease, and one which grips people of all backgrounds, and that your struggle is not an isolated one. On that basis, you also need the support of people, and coming here is the right thing to do. Not only that, but within you, is the strength you had before, and will have after, not doing drugs. Before you did drugs, that's you, you are still that person and you can still find your future without drugs. 

Realise that, by even asking for help, you have stepped towards the truth and dipped your toe out of the darkness and into some light. You may feel free to reply here or message me if you like, as I'd be more than happy to help anyone with either spiritual or non-spiritual coping mechanisms that have worked for me, and how I came to discover their power/capability to cure my disease.

You MUST learn to despise the impact it is having. You MUST learn to see the drugs as the enemy, a spell that you are under which knows your deepest desires. You should put on all the armour and equip yourself as best you can to tackle with that foe, because it is so potent and strong - but not with the correct remedy. 

**Contact me if you want to chat**

Finally, please keep faith and remember that you are a NOT a body that has a soul, you ARE a soul that has a body, and you can redeem it. You CAN win, and you CAN be redeemed, but you must seek and ask. 

I hope this helps somebody, and as I said already, please message me if you would like to chat or need to get anything out of your head. 

**God Bless, and peace to you.**",1612072274

I was taking 1700 mgs of oxys day/ ibogaine,7,l8oj5t,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l8oj5t/i_was_taking_1700_mgs_of_oxys_day_ibogaine/,6,"Hey Guys, I just wanted to share my experience with ibogaine  treatment and how it changed my life in the most honest way possible for people that are seeking treatment. I was addicted to opiates (oxys) for almost 15 years and got up to 1700 mgs 70 perc 30s a day towards the end for 3 consistent years. It was just an absolute nightmare waking up having to snort 10 pills just to get out of bed then 3 hours later another 10 and so on. I truly wanted to die I had no more euphoria at all from these pills. 

I was up two years ago standing outside and said to the universe I need help now or I am going to die please show me something. I called a methadone clinic they wouldn’t accept me unless I weaned down to about 600 mgs which was impossible to do. I really felt hopeless at that point. The next night my audio engineer sent a post about ibogaine from a Podcast and I was shocked. No way there is something out there that can take away the physical and mental withdrawal in such short time and bring my mind back to a pre addictive state. So I started to call treatment centers I had just enough money to go to one and I would be broke but I didn't care. Most places I called were either sketchy or would tell me to send the money upfront. As an addict when you are seeking help it can be a very scary process. I ended up going to a place and taking the risk luckily it was safe and I got treatment.

Now I will say even though the place saved my life I didn't like the owner and besides the treatment didn't offer much assistance on aftercare. It still was the best decision I made because it broke the addiction and I had very minimal withdrawal if any at all. So basically i took 3 flood doses over 14 days and the first one wow I got up 4 hours after the treatment and I said to myself there is no way I am not sick and have not taken any pills in 24 hours!!!! The next few days I just felt very tired and wanted to rest they give you gabapentin to help sleep and vitamins in an IV to replenish your system. On the 4th day I took another full treatment and this was the one. I had this very warm feeling all over my body of love from the universe and I could vividly see my life and what was holding me back from staying sober all the way down to my childhood. I was sober for 3 years through AA and the twelve steps it was like writing a fourth step in 4 hours it was just so humbling and enlightening.

Now people out there who say you go through 0 Withdrawals in my experience it wasn't true you have beaten your body up for years so there is no slap on the wrist. If I were to say out of 100 percent I felt 75 percent after that second treatment physically but the difference between this ibogaine and anything else I could have done was that my mind was clear, awake, and not depressed no PAWS. So I had the mental and spiritual strength to say holy shit I can really do this I cant believe it. 

A few days later I got my final treatment and that is the one that took care of the lingering 25% stuff physically I had going on. Now what I mean physically is it was not anything unbearable. I basically just was a little sweaty not cold sweats and hot flashes. I just felt my body cleaning itself in a good way. My mind was seriously so clear and lazar focused. The only physical symptoms I had the whole time was I had trouble sleeping because my mind was so awake from the ibogaine and I was just tired Physically for a few weeks. Every-time they gave me a treatment though I would feel great physically. 

Now if you are trying to just go take ibogaine and think its a cure you need to think different. You need to understand it gives you a window of opportunity to not feel like shit and focus on long term recovery without having to wait months for mental and physical symptoms to go away. If you use ibogaine as a detox tool and set up aftercare which the place I am in touch with now that I went back for a tune up does your chances of full recovery will be very high.

Anyways I don't want to make this to long just remember I was on 1700 Milagrams Of OXY a day that is the worst of the worst pill habit you can have and I truly just want to help people and not have them feel they are going to mexico and are going to get robbed or ripped off be very careful before you chose which center. 

If anyone has any questions please pm me I will be more than happy to help and guide you in the right direction. You deserve a better life we all do we never wanted to become this way and just know as bad as it feels now you are exactly were you are supposed to be and one day you will know why you went through everything you went through. 

I love you all stay strong",1612051069

Day 25 Almost Relapsed Yesterday,3,l8rid1,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l8rid1/day_25_almost_relapsed_yesterday/,0,"First of all, I wanna say thank you for all there (mostly) overwhelming support I have received. Yes, I'm 16 for those who could tell I was young. I was in the very early stages of opioid addiction. Someone called me a garbage can and I think that perfectly sums it up. Some of you probably saw my, what I like to call when the drug demon comes out, posts. I had questions about heroin and such, of course, clear-headed it's not something I want to try. 

Anyways, about last night. It was late and I could tell my urges were getting worse and worse so I hit a meeting. I spoke to where I was and I was worried I was going to relapse and that I was not doing great. I got a list of numbers and went home. When I got home I was deep into my drug mind. I figured out that there is a guy who lives less than a minute walking distance away from me and is selling Vicodin(my poison) at 5 a pop. Of course, I hear this and immediately start to sell my shit. I had started to go outside to sell an Xbox controller when I got caught by my mom. She didn't know what I was doing but I ended up not being able to sell it. Which I believe is a small miracle. Otherwise, I would have been high that night.

I finally ended up stop ignoring my sponsor and I gave him a call. He was very supportive and I told him what had happened. I told him even from those little interactions with my mom and being secretive and reverting back to addict behavior I didn't want to live like that again. 

I realize I have to do something different in my life. I have to change my mindset. I must set myself up for success otherwise I will end up a true heroin addict or dead from the pills in a month or two. I know that because that's how I am and I can't ever stop. I know the nights are when it gets difficult and I have this toxic obsession with getting high that completely consumes me. I need to workout or plan my evenings so I don't have time to think about drugs, when I'm busy I can be clean.  


Thank you for reading. Additionally, I have a website that discloses addicts' stories and helps carry the message to the addict who still suffers. I know I don't have long clean but it's been helping me stay clean. Any support would be awesome! If you want to add your story j hmu.

How Enduring Childhood Abuse And Addiction Has Made Me A Better Mother,2,l8sess,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l8sess/how_enduring_childhood_abuse_and_addiction_has/,0,"I don’t speak of this often, because I’m ashamed of it, but my ex boyfriend’s son was witness to a lot of my drug addicted behavior. Both my ex and I were opiate addicts, heroin addicts, methadone addicts. I met him in the last year of my active addiction, and I was no longer a person anymore. I was simply a body void of hope, faith, and life. My ex only got his son a few days out of the month, which was for the best. When we did pick him up, it was after our dope run, and then we’d go again after we dropped him off.

Towards the end of my addiction, things were the worst they’d ever been, and I would put myself in something called a ‘soma coma’ on a regular basis. Soma are a muscle relaxant, about as close present day as you can get to barbiturates, and if you take enough, they will render you completely unconscious and unaware of your surroundings for hours. Think Wolf Of Wall Street type shit. Despite taking copious amounts drugs, no other drug did that for me, and while it wasn’t a pleasant high, I didn’t want to be alive anymore. So being in a coma for a few hours, even a soma coma, was the closest I could get to being dead without a gun. They would put me in near full respiratory failure without actually killing me, cause me to lose all my faculties, up to and including my speech and body movement, and essentially paralyze me for approximately five hours at a time. Through much trial and error, I knew the exact amount I needed to take to render myself fully unconscious for many numb and glorious hours on end. One time I didn’t take enough, and I woke up simply paralyzed, unable to move to open the bottle and take more, and trapped inside my own treasonous mind and body. I would repeat this process til all the pills were gone, and lose days on end. In the last year of my addiction, I was only conscious about six months out of that year, if that. I embodied hopeless and I lived in hell. I remember a time when we went to a movie at the theater, and I couldn’t get out of the bathroom stall. My pants were down, I couldn’t talk, and the employees had to go get my ex to physically dress and remove me. It’s not the first time it happened, sadly, but this time my ex’s son was with us. It confirmed for me exactly why I never wanted to be a parent, as I had become everything my mother was. It was shortly thereafter that my ex and I split, and I entered a drug treatment facility, miraculously recovering against literally all odds.

In recovery, I was forced to face difficult truths about my past, develop healthy coping mechanisms that I had never before known, and say goodbye to my toxic and addicted parents. My brain was being rewired, and I attended therapy daily. I used to think it was all bullshit, the boo hooing on a couch, and that it would supposedly set me free. Give me a fucking break, man. But that’s what prevented me from recovering for so long was my hopeless and shitty attitude. Hope is a commodity that we in the addiction community are in terribly short supply of, and when you take hope away from a person, as a child especially, there is no longer a reason to live, and you indulge in killing yourself as a result. Once I realized I could live without the drugs I’d been consuming every day for fifteen years, I once again had hope, and I allowed myself to do literally everything the rehab and my therapist told me to do. I surrendered. You hear that phrase a lot from those of us in recovery, and I’ll be the first to tell you, that it sounds empty and futile. My thought was always: Don’t tell me you surrendered, tell me exactly how you were able to recover step by step, because it sounds like some fucking fairytale you recovery radicals made up to give the rest of us hopeless, addicted souls some false hope.

But I was wrong, I was fighting with my body’s need to continue using, and rebelling against allowing myself to become vulnerable about my past with other people. Stopping drugs isn’t what made me recover; becoming vulnerable and allowing myself to stop fighting other people, to let my true self come out instead of masking it with anger for fear of what I would say, that’s when my recovery really began. That’s what filled me with hope. I’ve heard it said that recovery is simple, not easy. That’s the best way to describe it really. None of it was easy, but it was as simple as everyone said it was. I just didn’t want to allow myself to believe that when I was using. Once I stopped thinking everything was bullshit, and actually started listening to people who wanted to help me, attending therapy and putting into practice everything they wanted me to do, it really did set me free.

It was then that I began to dissect my thoughts about becoming a mother, and realize that I wasn’t her, and that I never would be. I was doing something she never did, and I wasn’t the evil person I thought I was, just because I grew up with one.

My husband and I planned having my son, and we planned having the baby inside me now. I never thought I’d have a child at all, let alone two planned ones. I realized that my parents had given me a template of all the things to do wrong, and that by my doing the exact opposite, I could give my son the life I never had, and I did. I broke the generational curse, and the cycle of abuse that had been carried from my grandma, to my mother, to me, but that’s where it stopped.

The hopelessness of my addiction has allowed me now to appreciate every day of my life; it fills me with a love and gratitude of life that only those on the brink of death can really understand. It has given me an empathy and understanding of the life of the down trodden, and I have passed that along to my son. He will know and understand, like I do, that no person is beyond hope, love, and worthiness of help.

Enduring childhood trauma and abuse, as well as addiction, is not something I would wish upon anyone. But in the end, overcoming abuse and addiction, has made me a better mother.

I’m addicted coke and weed. I can’t deny it. I’m at rock bottom too and am in financial ruins. I tried an outpatient addictions program and just kept using the whole time. It wasn’t enough.

What I’ve recently come to terms with is the fact I need rehab. Like inpatient rehab complete with an initial period of detox. At this point in my addiction to coke, I’m using to avoid the withdrawal as much as I am chasing a high. 

The withdrawal period terrifies me. I anticipate experiencing extreme emotional dysregulation, depression, anxiety, and possibly suicidal ideation. I need to do this in a medically supervised environment. 

I’ve just written a lengthy and completely honest email to my parents that I will send in the next coming days. In it, I lay everything out on the table and ask for their financial support in the rehab bill as it will be at a private facility. 

I’m terrified to quit using coke and to take at least a long T Break. Entering rehab is beyond scary. But I just can’t keep using the way I am. It’s ruined my life and it happened so so quickly. I didn’t have a problem until I started using coke during this depressing pandemic as a way to cope with my loneliness.

I had horrible withdraws from cold sweats to not eating to night mares every night so bad I was terrified to even go to sleep. Well after that 2 weeks I broke down and smoked a blunt.

"I’m worried I’m about to relapse, I need help",4,l8buqy,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l8buqy/im_worried_im_about_to_relapse_i_need_help/,9,"Sorry for wall of text, just want to share my full story:

For the past 3 years I’ve had a substance abuse issue with prescription amphetamines. It was relatively harmless for the first 2 years pre-pandemic, since I started at 30mgs of vyvanse and gradually moved up to 70mg during that 2 year period (70mg is the maximum legal dose that can be prescribed). During this time I was functional, completing my bachelors and even starting my masters degree overseas.

When the pandemic hit I started taking more to cope with the social isolation. My dosages at peak were upwards of 280mg per day. I only got to that point because in the fall I told my prescriber that I needed a higher dose because 70mg wasn’t effective so he gave me a script for 140mg/day for 3 months (6 sets of 30 capsules!). I took breaks in the beginning, never went above 140, and basically thought I had it under control. Because of the first 1-2 “stable” months I had saved up a lot of pills and started gradually upping the dose until I was at 280mgs/day at which point I quickly ran out. My prescriber had no idea about any of this and thought I was taking 140mg every day. I was confronted with the decision to schedule another appointment and refill my 140mg/day script and act like everything was fine, or admit I had a problem. I chose the latter. 

When things were really bad at the beginning of december and I was fearing for my heart health I confided in everyone close to me (housemates, girlfriend, and my mom who is an alcoholic herself but clean for several years). I’ve determined that I have what alcoholics call an “allergy” to their substance of choice and that the introduction of any amphetamine into my system is a no-go. I simply cannot discipline myself to just take my prescribed dose and that it was either all or nothing, so I chose nothing. That was at the beginning of January. I’ve been clean for almost a month now. I also take Welbutrin (300mg) daily which helped massively with the withdrawals.

Yesterday I felt like I was in a trance. I woke up feeling pretty good actually, but I made the mistake of lying in bed too long and not getting up, which made me start to self-loathe and think about how a script refill was only a phone call away. Needless to say I made the call, had the appointment in the same day, and picked up my script at the pharmacy in the afternoon. At each point in my day leading up to the script refill I had many points where I told myself to turn back and stop but I felt like I was being mind controlled. It pains me so much because I’m finally starting to feel functional without vyvanse, and now I’ve just refilled my script and told no one close to me about it because I’m ashamed. It’s 3am and I’m dreading tomorrow morning because I know I’m probably going to take it and I’m trying to come to terms with that. I probably need to change the environmental elements that cause me to feel negative emotion and use in the first place, but I don’t know what they are. 

Need some counseling :/




Tl;dr Addicted to prescription amphetamines for 3 years, quit at the start of January due to health concerns and am now 1 month clean. In a trance, I refilled my script yesterday in secret and am dreading tomorrow because I’m probably going to relapse. Don’t know how this happened.",1612003478

The worst part,7,l7y9cw,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7y9cw/the_worst_part/,1,"""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.""

\-some redditor’s friend

I’m pretty crazy. I mean I know that's not a great way to say I have a whole host of mental problems, but it’s the way I’m feeling when I see peoples reactions to my behaviour. Some four years ago I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety. “Ok, that doesn’t sound too bad, a mild case then.” I thought, completely unable to connect that to my experience. Only later on I realized it’s not the lack of seriousness hiding behind the condition's name, but that of narrowing its occurrence qualifiers. Because my anxiety shoots at will. I mean there are some recurring themes, events involving other people, being judged, broadly speaking, rejected,  but pretty much anything can trigger it. The impending doom vibe of 2020, was just fucking peachy for me. 

I’m 34 now, and for almost all of my life I didn’t even know I was afraid. “Now that sounds like you’re just …” I’ll stop you right there, ok? Because, you see, that’s where it connects to another issue that's making my life miserable. Difficult, strong emotions, are lava. And I will do the most bizarre thighs to avoid them. All of my coping mechanisms are ways to escape. I'm a trash junkie, more on that later. I don’t need food or sleep when playing an exciting game or binging a tv show or a yt channel. I fall into delusional thinking, and outright fantasy lands, on a dime. Everyone I ever knew I pushed away preemptively. Oh, and let’s not forget the depression, the hideous face of which is in my rear mirror at all times. Yeah, I’m so happy and proud, I made a thing today with an old power cord.

I stated my age just there, to say something of my dedication to escape. I’ve been so consistent with it, I never recognized my pursuers. Well, not until a while after that diagnosis at least. I always called it stress or tension if I had to call it anything. Never stopped to look behind, always running, late I started looking for appropriate medical assistance. Wanna know a fun thing? Relationships with professionals also make me want to get out. And so none lasted long enough to actually help me much. But at least I learned enough bits and pieces to be able to write something hopefully consistent and true about it all at this moment.

I called myself trash junkie earlier because it never really mattered what psychoactive substance I used, as long as it made me feel good and calm. There was alcohol, as all of my teen peers drank. There was mj cause it was fun to laugh, eat and forget. But codeine stuck the longest because it was easy. Any pharmacy, no prescription, cheap, no interactions with anybody, but at the counter for 20 seconds. And then bliss for a while. It’s very weak compared to other opiates, but required so little of me, It was enough combined with computer addiction to keep me in stasis for about ten fucking years. Until it wasn’t. Over the years, very slowly accumulated knowledge of myself and the reality of my life pushed me more and more to wanting to break this spell, to escape, lul.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2019. A medium length period of stable sobriety, and some of the more honest introspections I ever experienced, resulted in a new pursuit to address another problem I had, “difficulties with thinking”, yych. The attention deficit part of the condition explained perfectly for me at the time why there’s two conflicting sets of memories I have about myself. One of a ridiculous idiot, and another of a moderately intelligent person. There are some specific conditions, which if met make it a lot easier for a sufferer to focus and maintain a consistent train of thought. There were complications however, ADHD is treated with stimulants, and I had immense difficulty not to abuse the medication. As with benzos for anxiety.  Eventually I relapsed with codeine, and upon revealing that to my doctor, the treatment seized. It lasted enough though to launch me into a few weeks of demented narciccism. Always had some tendencies, mostly tempered with depression and no self esteem at all. But once in a while it turns to 11, and well, it’s not a pretty sight to see. I have profound regrets.

Oh, right, the title. Well, I don’t really think it’s the worst thing anymore, but it sounded comforting, mabie because it placed the blame solely on other people. Some understanding would be nice tho. Right now I think the worst is that all of those problems are a perpetual self sustaining feedback loop of doom and despair. Not only trouble in itself but also a way to make getting out more difficult. I couldn’t ask for help if my life depended on it, heh. Don’t really have anybody to ask anymore anyway. Ok, I’m done lamenting my situation. It’s 8 day without codeine this time. I’m at a crossroads, and I have no idea what will happen.",1611969690

Mantras For Addiction Recovery,2,l7xow9,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7xow9/mantras_for_addiction_recovery/,0," **Mantras For Addiction Recovery**

While the word mantra originated as a Hindu “sacred utterance,” people use mantras every day to guide their efforts at home, at work, and at school. The popular culture definition of mantra has evolved to mean repetitive slogan, personal truth, or structured thought. Adopting one or more mantras as part of your addiction recovery experience is a focused way to achieve your objectives and remain motivated. Words have a powerful way of changing behaviors, thought patterns, and emotions over time. Consider mantras a tool in your toolbox: useful for chanting when you are tempted to use or for achieving focused calm during meditation.

**Mantras for Drug & Alcohol Treatment**

I am a worthwhile, deserving person. By undervaluing themselves, addicts spiral into a dangerous pattern of self-deprecation and low self-esteem. Use this mantra as a reminder that you are lovable, valuable, and deserving of wellness and joy.

I am in control of my life. At first, these words may seem hollow. After all, most addicts feel as if their lives are spinning out of control with drugs and alcohol in the driver’s seat. Use this mantra to take a stand. Addiction does not control you; you are in control of your destiny and you have a supportive rehabilitation team ready to help.

I am not alone. Feelings of isolation can quickly give way to destructive behaviors. When you are in the grip of loneliness, remind yourself of this truth and call on your community of family, friends, and counselors to help you avoid making a negative choice.

I am making progress. While your steps may seem small, you are moving in the right direction when you seek addiction treatment. Live in the moment, celebrating small triumphs and reminding yourself that each forward step takes you further from the bondage of addiction and toward the freedom of sobriety.

I will not give in to my drug or alcohol craving today. While it is important to acknowledge that sobriety is a lifelong effort, getting through today is the most important thing on your agenda. Chant this mantra when you are feeling tempted to drink or use drugs. Meditate on it when you are in the middle of a stressful situation. Resisting substance use today fuels you to take another stand tomorrow.

How to deal with withdrawal anxiety and depression? Please help!,3,l7qi2a,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7qi2a/how_to_deal_with_withdrawal_anxiety_and/,5,"TLDR: Its my first week of withdrawal. Im so anxious, paranoid, depressed and having hot/cold waves. I think im losing my mind. I need some advice, any help is appreciated.

Hi. So, I've been using buprenorphine, benzodiazepines and weed 5 years on daily basis. I've been 1 week in rehab at the moment. 
Im feeling so sick, i think im losing my mind.. Its so hard to even focus and write this post. It feels like im going to die. My heart is pounding, im sweating, feeling cold, anxious, depressed having thoughts everyone tries to hurt or kill me. 
I'm currently on diazepam medication, doctor gives me only 5mg of diazepam 4 times a day. It won't help at all, only helps me to not have seizures. I can take olanzapine, clonidine, melatonin, hydroxyzine and propanonol if necessary. But those won't do anything else, than put me to zombiemode and still having these feelings. It's hard to sleep even with all these meds together. 
My friend brought me 2mg buprenorphine, because i had suicidal thoughts and almost tried to kill my self with these meds. I feel so desperate. Now my feeling is somehow better, obviously because of bupe. So i use this advantage to write this post and asking help/advice. How the **** can I cope with these feelings... I know i will eventually get better but thinking that won't help. 
This rehab feels like torturing. Now it's been only 1 week and my doctor reduced my 5mg x 4mg diazepam meds to 5mg x 3mg. Im supposed to be here 2 week in total and these medication reductions are brutal. Everyday she (doctor) takes 5mg off, and I have to be last 2 days WITHOUT ANY BENZODIAZEPINES. And after 2 weeks have passed, they move me to rehab where medications aren't allowed. I know already i will have horrible withdrawals when im without meds, because im already feeling too bad. Im hopeless, i cant even exercise here, because this COVID-19 situation. I find exercising even somehow helpful. We can go for a walk 30 minutes/day. I can leave from here whenever i want, but i know that only leads to me start using drugs again.. What can i do? 😭

Some background information here;
I have had terrible childhood. I were in children care institution (or what is it called idk, im from Finland, so my english isn't perfect). 
My mom was depressed because my dad left us when i was only 2 years old. And I have ADHD, so she couldn't do anything else but send me there when i were 10yrs old. In the children care place the people who worked there beated us, insulted us and were very harsh and mean to us. And one 12yrs old girl got raped by one of the workers. It was sick place and affected everyone mentally. I started using weed, alcohol and benzos in age of 13 because of these horrible things they did to us. We told social workers and cops about these things and the workers said we are being delusional and wanted to ruin their reputation. 
I got PTSD, General Anxiety Disorder, Chronic depression and terrible childhood thanks to them. That lead me to use drugs. I tried to kill myself several times but i couldn't because it is hard to do. Im glad i didn't end up killing myself tho.. 

I got released from that shitty place when i was 18. I had wonderful time, I fell in love and got my past love of my life pregnant. And now i have reason to live. A wonderful son. We were 4 years together and broke. After that i fell into a rabbithole. My dreams crushed and I started to do what was familiar to me. Stifle my feelings with drugs. So here i am. I need to stop using drugs because of my 5yrs old son. He is my everything and reason to live.

Thank you in advance...",1611949225

"Is it possible for a habitual, years-long cigarette smoker to never become addicted?",3,l7h5gm,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7h5gm/is_it_possible_for_a_habitual_yearslong_cigarette/,8,"Let me start by saying that I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this question. r/Cigarettes didn't really seem right, so I came here. Hope that's okay.

Anyway, I (22 f) have been smoking for 8 years, since I was 14. I've always liked cigarettes, so that's why I smoke them. But I have never felt addicted, I've never experienced withdrawals, etc. When I'm too broke, I don't buy them and I have no problem going without. It's rare that I do go without them, but when I have to, it's not a big deal. Sometimes I go without smoking just cause I don't feel like smoking. Usually cigarettes smell and taste great to me, but there are moments when I think they smell and taste awful. Sometimes for many days at a time, but never more than a week or so. 

From a chemical/psychological/medical standpoint, is it possible for me to not be addicted? I wasn't a \*big\* smoker when I was a young teen because they were hard to get my hands on, but ever since I was about 17 I've been smoking at least a few packs a week, sometimes a pack a day (except when I've been too broke, or when I just didn't feel like smoking for a while). I have no intention or desire to quit but that's only because I like to smoke. Am I lying to myself? I literally don't know what withdrawals feel like, but I don't understand how that is possible. 

My mom (50 f) has told me that she smoked for a couple of years in her youth but easily quit cold turkey when she found out she was pregnant. The same thing happened with my sister (29 f) who smoked from 22-27 years old. But our other sister (31 f) is very much addicted to cigarettes since she was 18, and has been trying to quit for years with only short periods of success. 

I just have a hard time believing it's possible for me not to be addicted, even though I also know that I'm not, and I believe my mom & sister never were either. 

I did some googling but couldn't really find anything conclusive. I understand that you all may have some knowledge about addiction here, so any of your insight would be really valuable and appreciated. 

I wish everyone the best of luck with their recovery. Thank you for taking the time.",1611917764
Sober Living Homes,2,l7fuqh,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7fuqh/sober_living_homes/,0,"Sober living is an incredibly valuable tool for recovery, as it allows recent inpatient clients (and some intensive outpatient clients) to live in a drug- and alcohol-free home with other individuals who are focused on recovery. Sober living is especially helpful for those transitioning out of rehab centers who would prefer to start out in a safe, temptation-free environment.

For most clients, sober living at [Oak Forest Recovery](https://oakforestrecovery.com/) becomes an option after the initial residential treatment portion of the program is successfully completed. Within the structure of sober living, each client is equipped to effectively integrate their sober foundation with real-life fundamentals. Each Men & Women’s house is managed by a full-time house manager, and the purpose of each house is to offer clients the practical support of living sober on their own.

The life of recovery is one that is built over time, and we believe in a commitment to daily, healthy habits that are established with repetition and discipline. Within the family environment, clients find that returning to work, school, and daily life is more easily accomplished in the presence of like-minded people.

**What are Sober Living Homes?**

A sober living home is a specialized residence designed to provide a safe, substance-free environment for those recovering from drug or alcohol addiction. Residents cook, clean, manage finances, and take care of other everyday responsibilities independently, just as they would in any other home. Residents live, eat, socialize, and attend 12-step meetings together as roommates, supporting one another through the challenges of maintaining their newfound sobriety.

At **Oak Forest Recovery** , we recognize that not all clients will be ready to return to “normal life” right away. We also recognize that the journey of recovery for each client has its own unique pace. Once a client is accepted to a sober living house, he or she is welcome to stay for as long as needed, even if it takes years.

If you need transitional living space after an inpatient rehab program, you may be struggling to decide between living with loved ones or applying for a place in a sober living facility. To determine whether sober living is a good fit for you",1611914159
Why do we do this?,1,l7jfq8,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/l7jfq8/why_do_we_do_this/,4,"Man,  this morning I was bitching about quitters flu. Guess what I'm bitching about at 1 in the morning. Makes me wonder how many other dangerous or unhealthy things we do to ourselves on a regular basis that we don't realize because we're inured to it. Maybe some people can lightly bitch with me. 

Not the most harmful, or destructive, or the ones you'll read on posters, but what are the side effects from withdrawal/quitting that you've found most annoying. Insomnia and dry mouth for me. The insomnia is so consistent.  Like honestly, quitting drugs is better than  coffee when it comes to keeping me awake.",1611924102

my friend at the time (now girlfriend) saved me and we’ve been living together ever since. her lease is up in a few days, and moving has been really stressful. we procrastinated too much and there’s so much packing to do and we have to put all our shit on a uhaul. there are boxes everywhere, our stuff is all over the place in our 490 square foot apartment and it’s making my chest feel tight.

I understand it works great for some people and they use it pretty much for life, in fact most NA/AA people never stop going. However I think there is an underlining issue behind this that most people ignore. I also touch on mental health medications which if that's something else people would be interested in, I'm not proud of this but I've been on quite a few different kind of medications ranging from SSRI, SNRI, NDRI, atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants (gabapentin). Yeah I know I'm like a walking pharmacy but I was miss diagnosed so many times . I still don't know what if any disorders they were right about because most of it was diagnosed while I was using heavily and that changes who you are point blank period.
